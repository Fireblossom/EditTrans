cellent agreement with the analytical results, verifying their consistency under weak driving conditions. It is noteworthy that the optimal value leading to a complete photon-magnon blockade is achieved through analytical calculations. 

Figures  3 (a)3 (b) display the second-order correlation function \(g_{j}^{(2)}(0)\) ( \(j=m,c\)) as a function of the detuning \(\Delta\)for different values of \(\lambda\), while keeping other parameters fixed. It is observed that the values of \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\) are significantly smaller for the listed \({\Delta,\lambda}\) pairs than for others. Specifically, Figure 3 (a) demonstrates a strong unconventional magnon blockade effect at \(\Delta=9.03\omega_{b}\) with \(\lambda=2\times 10^{-4}\omega_{b}\), while Figure 3 (b) shows a strong unconventional photon blockade effect at \(\Delta=-0.03\omega_{b}\) with \(\lambda=4\times 10^{-4}\omega_{b}\). These results agree with the analytically calculated optimal parameters. We note that when \(\lambda=0\), implying the absence of magnon squeezing, the unconventional magnon blockade (UMB) cannot be achieved, whereas the conventional magnon blockade (CMB) is attainable at \(\Delta\approx 4.5\omega_{b}\), as shown in Figure  3 (a). Additionally, for instance, when \(\lambda=500\) Hz, a small dip appears corresponding to the conventional magnon blockade, as depicted in Figure 3 (a). On the other hand, in Figure  2 (a), when \(\lambda=\lambda^{opt}\), another small dip exists with \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)>1\), indicating a bunching effect. As anticipated in Figure  2 (b), the different curves lack a sharp dip, implying photon blockade cannot be achieved. 

FIG. 4. (a) Time evolution of the second-order correlation function, \(g_{m}^{(2)}(\tau)\)\((t=0)\), (b) Plot of \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\) as a function of \(t\)\((\tau=0)\). See the text for value of other parameters. 

In Fig.  4 (a), we depict the time evolution of the secondorder correlation function \(g_{m}^{(2)}(\tau)\), which is calculated using the expression: 

\[g_{m}^{(2)}(\tau)=\frac{\langle m^{\dagger}(t)m^{\dagger}(t+\tau)m(t+\tau)m(t) \rangle}{\langle m^{\dagger}(t)m(t)\rangle^{2}}.\] (8)  

This quantity is a significant measure of the photon statistical properties. It is proportional to the joint probability of detecting one photon at \(t=0\) and detecting the next photon at \(t=\tau\). It can be observed that for delay times \(\tau>0\), \(g_{m}^{(2)}(\tau)\) is greater than \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\). This indicates that the emitted photons exhibit blockade behavior and possess sub-Poissonian statistics. Notably, as the delay time \(\tau\) increases, \(g_{m}^{(2)}(\tau)\) also increases and approaches its maximum value (unity) at \(\tau=1.6\mu\)s, which corresponds approximately to the lifetime of the photons in the cavity. This signifies that with increasing time delay, photons become more coherent and exhibit stronger correlation. 

In Fig.  4 (b), we present the time evolution of the secondorder correlation function, \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\). It can be observed that \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\) decreases as time increases. Additionally, there is a significant oscillation in the initial short time, which is a result of the classical driving field. However, this oscillation gradually stabilizes, reaching a steady state. Throughout the time evolution, the second-order correlation function remains below 1 ( \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\ll 1\)), ensuring the validity of a strong magnon blockade. 

### Pure dephasing effects 

Pure dephasing can have a negative impact on the magnon (photon) blockade characteristics and introduce unwanted de

coherence in the system. Hence, we investigate the influence of pure dephasing on cavity photon antibunching characteristics. To model the effects of pure dephasing, an additional Lindblad term of the form \(\mathcal{L}_{p}(\rho)=\frac{\gamma_{p}}{2}[2c^{{\dagger}}c\rho c^{\dagger}c-(c ^{{\dagger}}c)^{2}\rho-\rho(c^{{\dagger}}c)^{2}]\) is included in the master equation, where \(\gamma_{p}\) represents the pure dephasing rate of the cavity mode. 

In Fig.  5 (a)-(b), we present the plots of the equal-time second-order correlation function \(g_{j}^{(2)}(0)\)\((j=m,c)\) against the detuning \(\Delta\)for various values of the pure-dephasing rates \(\gamma_{p}\). We observe that even after including pure-dephasing induced losses in the system, photon blockade and magnon blockade remain robust. When \(\gamma_{p}=0\), \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\) exhibits strong sub-Poissonian quantum statistics at the detuning \(\Delta=\omega_{b}\). Furthermore, \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\) increases with increasing decay rates \(\gamma_{p}\). In other words, for higher pure-dephasing rates, \(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\) approaches classical Poissonian statistics similar to a thermal source, as expected (Fig.  5 (a)). Similar features can be observed for \(g_{c}^{(2)}(0)\) for this value of \(\gamma_{p}\)(Fig.  5 (b)).
