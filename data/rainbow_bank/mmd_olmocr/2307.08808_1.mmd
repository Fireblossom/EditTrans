Cooper pair bound states is lifted under confinement, and Cooper pairs in the \(p_{x}\) and \(p_{y}\) orbitals have a lower energy, hence are energetically favored to undergo condensation. In Sec. II, we confirm this perspective within the framework of mean-field theory. We show that the \(3\times 3\)order parameter splits into two sub-order parameters with different transition temperatures: a \(3\times 2\)matrix and a \(3\times 1\)matrix. We find that the \(3\times 2\)matrix has a higher transition temperature and is thus the only relevant order parameter at the superfluid transition. 

A fascinating problem, inherent to symmetry breaking described by matrix order parameters in general, concerns the question of which particular matrix is chosen during spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the present case, the Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional derived from mean-field theory features many energetically degenerate ground states. For instance, mean-field theory does not dictate whether time-reversal symmetry is broken or not at the transition. This degeneracy of ground states at the mean-field level is common in similar systems such as bulk He-3 [1], d-wave superconductivity in 3D [34, 35], triple-point fermions [36], or complex tensor order [37, 38]. Remarkably, we find that in the present case, the many degenerate ground states actually only consists of two physically inequivalent configurations, the A-phase and the planar phase, whereas all other minima are related to these two via a symmetry transformation from  \(\tilde{G}\)\(\tilde{G}\). 

To resolve the question of whether the A-phase or the planar phase is energetically favored, we apply two theoretical approaches. First, we use the best available strong-coupling corrections for the Landau free energy from the 3D system and confirm that the A-phase is favored at the transition for all pressures. Second, we use weak-coupling perturbative renormalization group (RG) to incorporate order parameter fluctuations in the confined system, which predicts the planar phase to be favorable instead. This mismatch with observations indicates that even low pressures do not correspond to a weak coupling, but we also speculate on general issues of the perturbative RG to resolve second-order phase transitions of matrix order parameters. The lifting of the mean-field degeneracy due to fluctuations in the RG is unlike the case discussed in Ref. [36], where the degeneracy is protected by an enlarged symmetry. Experimentally, measuring the absence or presence of time-reversal symmetry at the transition could determine the condensation of the A-phase or planar phase, respectively. 

## PHYSICAL PICTURE: THE COOPER PROBLEM 

To illuminate the effect of confinement on the superfluid state, we first examine the associated Cooper problem. This amounts to solving the two-particle Schr¨odinger equation in the presence of a static Fermi surface (FS). The formation of a bound state, the Cooper pair, and its functional dependence on the system parameters is often a good approximation of the superfluid instability found within mean-field theory for the actual many-body system, such as in spin- or mass-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gases [39]. 

In the original Cooper problem, two atoms in 3D that experience a two-dimensional FS are interacting attractively, which leads to the formation of a shallow bound state. The atoms are described by the two-particle Schr¨odinger equation 

\[\left[-\frac{\hslash^{2}}{4m}\nabla_{\mathbf{R}}^{2}-\frac{ \hslash^{2}}{m}\nabla_{\mathbf{r}}^{2}-2\mu-V(r)\right]\psi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf {r})=E\psi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{r}),\] (1)  

where \(\mathbf{R}=(X,Y,Z)^{T}\)and \(\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)^{T}\)are the centerof-mass and relative coordinates of the two atoms, respectively, \(\mu\) is the chemical potential, and \(V(r)\)the interaction potential. Here \(\psi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{r})\)is the orbital part of the two-particle wavefunction. The spin part of the wavefunction is assumed to be a triplet state and has been factored out. To model confinement to quasi-2D, place the atoms in a box with length \(L_{i}\) in the \(i=x,y,z\) direction. The system is confined in the \(z\) direction in that \(L_{z}\) is comparable to the superfluid coherence length \(\xi=70\ \text{nm}\)of the bulk 3D system, whereas \(L_{x},L_{y}\gg\xi\). The Schr¨odinger equation is then solved with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the center-of-mass coordinate \(Z\), i.e. ψ(X,Y,Z=0,𝐫)=ψ(X,Y,Z=Lz,𝐫)=0, and periodic boundary conditions for the other coordinates. 

In order to solve Eq. (1), it is convenient to expand the wavefunction in basis functions that are compatible with the boundary conditions according to \(\psi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{r})=\sum_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{k}}\sin(q_{z}Z)e^{i(q_{x} X+q_{y}Y)}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\psi_{\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{k})/\mathcal {V}^{2}\). Here \(\mathbf{q}=(q_{x},q_{y},q_{z})^{T}\)and \(\mathbf{k}=(k_{x},k_{y},k_{z})^{T}\)denote the centerof-mass and relative wavevectors, respectively, and \(\mathcal{V}=L_{x}L_{y}L_{z}\) is the system volume. The wavevector \(q_{z}\) has a different quantization condition arising from the different boundary condition. We have \(q_{z}=\pi n/L_{z}\) whereas \(q_{x,y}=2\pi m_{x,y}/L_{x,y}\) and \(k_{x,y,z}=2\pi l_{x,y,z}/L_{x,y,z}\), with \(n=1,2,\dots\) and \(m_{x,y},l_{x,y,z}\in\mathbb{Z}\). In this basis, the Cooper problem reads 

\[\left(\xi_{\mathbf{k}_{+}}+\xi_{\mathbf{k}_{-}}\right)\psi_{\mathbf{q}}( \mathbf{k})-\frac{1}{\mathcal{V}}\sum_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}V(\mathbf{k}- \mathbf{k}^{\prime})\psi_{\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{k}^{\prime})=E\psi_{\mathbf{q}}( \mathbf{k}),\] (2)  

where \(\mathbf{k}_{\pm}=\mathbf{k}\pm\mathbf{q}/2\), \(\xi_{\mathbf{k}}=\hslash^{2}k^{2}/(2m)-\mu\) is the singleparticle energy dispersion, and \(V(\mathbf{k})=\int\text{d}^{3}re^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}V(r)\)is the interaction matrix element. In He-3, the dominant angular momentum channel is \(l=1\), and we choose \(V(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}^{\prime})=4\pi g\sum_{m=-1}^{1}Y_{1m}(\hat{\mathbf{k}} )Y_{1m}^{*}(\hat{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}})\), where \(g>0\)is the coupling constant and \(Y_{lm}(\hat{\mathbf{k}})=Y_{lm}(\theta_{\textbf{k}},\phi_{\textbf{k}})\)is the spherical harmonic of degree \(l\) and order \(m\). The corresponding Hamiltonian is time-reversal symmetric and, importantly, conserves the center-of-mass momentum \(\mathbf{q}\). Generally, a large \(\mathbf{q}\) will increase the energy of the bound state. Thus, we take \(\mathbf{q}\) to be the smallest admissible wavevector \(\mathbf{q}=(0,0,\pi/L_{z})\). This breaks the
