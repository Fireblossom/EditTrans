_Proof._ Let a proxy vote profile $(\boldsymbol{P},\boldsymbol{S},\boldsymbol{D})$be arbitrary. Pick some bijection $\psi:N\rightarrow N$. Then we must have 

\begin{align*}     f(\psi(\boldsymbol{P})_{\boldsymbol{\pi},\psi(\boldsymbol{S}),\psi(\boldsymbol{D})}) &= f(\psi(\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{\pi},\boldsymbol{S},\boldsymbol{D}})) &\text{(since $g$ is anonymous)} & \\     &= f(\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{\pi},\boldsymbol{S},\boldsymbol{D}}) &\text{(since $f$ is anonymous)} &\quad  \end{align*}

**Lemma 3** _ If_ $f$_ is neutral and_ $g$_ is proxy mechanism neutral, then_ $(f,g)$_ is_ _proxy vote neutral._ 

_Proof._ Let a proxy vote profile $(\boldsymbol{P},\boldsymbol{S},\boldsymbol{D})$be arbitrary. Pick some bijection $\psi:A\rightarrow A$. Then we must have 

\begin{align*}     f(\psi(\boldsymbol{P})_{\boldsymbol{\pi},\boldsymbol{S},\psi(\boldsymbol{D})}) &= f(\psi(\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{\pi},\boldsymbol{S},\boldsymbol{D}})) &\text{(since $g$ is neutral)} & \\     &= \psi(f(\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{\pi},\boldsymbol{S},\boldsymbol{D}})) &\text{(since $f$ is neutral)} &\quad  \end{align*}

Note that, in general, the other direction of Lemmas 2 and 3 won’t hold. 

### 5.3 A Proxy Vote Analogue of May’s Theorem 

When $|A|=2$, the _ majority rule_  selects the alternative which receives the most first choice votes. When $|N|$ is odd (meaning the majority rule is resolute), May (May 1952) shows that we can characterise the majority rule as the unique rule satisfying anonymity, neutrality and weak monotonicity. 

We can use the proxy vote analogues of these properties to achieve the same characterisation result. The key point is that setting $|A|=2$fully specifies the proxy mechanism $g$, by the definition of a proxy mechanism (since either a voter submits an empty order, meaning she is allowed to delegate to any other voter, or she submits a linear order, meaning she casts her vote directly). In effect, we are close to a classical vote; the only voters who delegate their votes are the voters who submit empty orders. So it is unsurprising that the following result holds irrespective of the choice of $g$. 

Theorem _ Suppose_ $|A|=2$_ and_ $|N|$_ is odd. Then a pair_ $(f,g)$_ satisfies_ 

**–** _ Proxy Vote Anonymity_ **–** _ Proxy Vote Neutrality_ **–** _ Proxy Vote Addition Monotonicity (PVAM), and_ **–** _ Proxy Vote Deletion Monotonicity (PVDM)_ 

_iff_ $f$_ is the majority rule._
