transfer matrix relating wave functions of different unit cells in the bulk of the chain is given by: 

\[T_{B}(E) =\begin{pmatrix}E/t_{L}&-t_{R}/t_{L}\\ 1&0\end{pmatrix}\] (6)  

As shown in Fig.  2  (a), the modulus of the largest eigenvalue of \(T_{B}(E)\)[Eq. ( 6 )] is smaller than 1 for any energy that lies within the limits of the PBC spectrum. This means that the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix connecting increasingly distant points of the 

Breakdown of bulk-edge correspondence in a system with an amplifying nonchain will be much smaller than 1. Hermitian impurity, model Eq. ( 4 ). (a) The modulus of the largest eigenvalue of \(T_{B}\)[Eq. ( 6 )] for all energies within the boundary defined by the PBC eigenvalues (in red), for \(t_{R}=0.9\)and \(t_{L}=1.1\).  (b)-(c) the smallest ratio of eigenvector components at the impurity \(|\Psi(x_{\mathrm{imp}})|^{2}\)and the eigenvector components at the left boundary \(|\Psi(x_{0})|^{2}\)as a function of the impurity strength \(h_{\mathrm{imp}}\) and impurity position \(x_{\mathrm{imp}}\) for (b) non-Hermitian ( \(t_{R}=0.0003\)and \(t_{L}=2980\)) and (c) Hermitian systems ( \(t_{R}=1\)and \(t_{L}=1\)). The bound \(|\lambda_{B}^{x_{\mathrm{imp}-2}}(E)\lambda_{\mathrm{imp}}(E)|=1\)[Eq. ( 3 )] is shown as a dotted line in (b) and (c), where \(E\) is the energy for which the modulus of the wave component at the impurity is the smallest. Plot details in App.  A . 

We now consider the system with an impurity ( \(h_{\mathrm{imp}}\neq 0\)). The transfer matrix relating (ψ(ximp),ψ(ximp−1))Tto \((\psi(x_{\mathrm{imp}-1}),\psi(x_{\mathrm{imp}-2}))^{T}\)is: 

\[\centering T_{\mathrm{imp}}(E)\@add@centering =\begin{pmatrix}e^{h_{\mathrm{imp}}}E/t_{L}&-e^{2h_{\mathrm{imp}} }t_{R}/t_{L}\\ 1&0\end{pmatrix}.\] (7)  

We diagonalize Eq. ( 4 ) for various hopping asymmetry strengths at the impurity located at \(x_{\mathrm{imp}}\), and extract the components of all the eigenvectors at the boundary \(\Psi_{n}(x_{0})\)and the components at the impurity site \(\Psi_{n}(x_{\mathrm{imp}})\). The smallest ratio of these components, 

\[\min_{n}|\Psi_{n}(x_{\mathrm{imp}})|^{2}/|\Psi_{n}(x_{0})|^{2}\] (8)  

belongs to the eigenstate of the system that is the most localized at the boundary. With decreasing impurity distance from the boundary and/or increasing impurity strength, this ratio can be made arbitrarily large [Fig.  2  (b)], indicating that all of the modes of the system accumulate at the impurity for a large enough hopping asymmetry at the impurity. We also calculate \(\lambda_{B}^{x_{\mathrm{imp}}-2}(E)\lambda_{\mathrm{imp}}(E)\), where \(E\) is the energy for which the modulus of the wave function at the impurity is the smallest. We use this expression to determine the threshold where the eigenvector most localized at the edge starts to shift towards the impurity, by plotting \(\lambda_{B}^{x_{\mathrm{imp}}-2}(E)\lambda_{\mathrm{imp}}(E)=1\). As shown in Fig.  (b), this threshold aligns with \(\min\limits_{n}|\Psi_{n}(x_{\mathrm{imp}})|^{2}/|\Psi_{n}(x_{0})|^{2}=1\), where the most localized eigenstate is
