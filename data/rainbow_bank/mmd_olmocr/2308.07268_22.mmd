**Figure 4**  The figure shows a cell in the shifted grid. The solid lines around the sides are the grid lines (and the region inside them is a cell). The shaded (green) region is the boundary region. Inside the boundary region, we divide the cell into \(1/h\times 1/h\) smaller cells. The distance between any two points in a smaller cell is \(<2/h\). All candidates in smaller cells are identical (i.e., candidates in blue regions). In this example, since only five cells are nonempty, we have at most \(2^{5}\)distinct failing sets. 

**Proof.**  Consider a failing set \(J\subseteq C\). Since \(T\) is a fault-tolerant committee, there exists a valid replacement set \(R\) such that \(|(T\backslash J)\cup R|\leqslant|T|\) and \(\sigma_{0}((T\backslash J)\cup R)\leqslant\sigma_{f}(T)\). Let \(L^{\prime}=\{l_{a}\in L:l_{a}\cap((T\backslash J)\cup R)\neq\emptyset\}\). Moreover, let \(J^{*}=J\cap T^{*}\). Then we will show that there exists a replacement set \(R^{*}\)for \(J^{*}\)such that \(|R^{*}|\leqslant|J^{*}|\) and \(\sigma_{0}((T^{*}\setminus J^{*})\cup R^{*})-\sigma_{0}((T\setminus J)\cup R) \leqslant 2/h\). 

We construct the set \(R^{*}\)as follows: Consider a cell \(l_{a}\in L^{\prime}\). Since \(l_{a}\cap((T\setminus J)\cup R)\neq\emptyset\), \(l_{a}\) is nonempty. This implies \(T^{*}\cap l_{a}\neq\emptyset\)from the way we construct \(T^{*}\). Let \(c_{a}\) be the only candidate in \(T^{*}\cap l_{a}\). If \(c_{a}\in J\), then we replace \(c_{a}\) with an arbitrary \(c_{a}^{\prime}\in l_{a}\setminus J\) (i.e., we add \(c_{a}^{\prime}\)to \(R^{*}\)). We know that such a candidate \(c_{a}^{\prime}\)exists because \(l_{a}\cap((T\backslash J)\cup R)\neq\emptyset\). Since we only add a candidate to \(R^{*}\)from \(l_{a}\) such that \(J^{*}\cap l_{a}\neq\emptyset\), we have \(|R^{*}|\leqslant|J^{*}|\). 

We will now show that \(\sigma_{0}((T^{*}\setminus J^{*})\cup R^{*})-\sigma_{0}((T\setminus J)\cup R) \leqslant 2/h\). Observe that for a pair of candidates \(c_{1},c_{2}\in l_{a}\), \(d(c_{1},c_{2})\leqslant 2/h\)). Let \(C_{a}=l_{a}\cap((T\setminus J)\cup R)\). Moreover, let \(V_{a}\subseteq V\) be the set of voters which have a candidate in \(C_{a}\) as their closest candidate in the committee \((T\setminus J)\cup R\). Using the triangle inequality, we know that \(d(V_{a},c_{a}^{\prime})\leqslant d(V_{a},C_{a})+2/h\). The above statement holds for all cells \(l_{a}\in L^{\prime}\). Therefore, \(\sigma_{0}((T^{*}\setminus J^{*})\cup R^{*})-\sigma_{0}((T\setminus J)\cup R) \leqslant 2/h\). 

Note that our proof works for an arbitrary failing set \(J\) including \(J=\emptyset\). This completes the proof of Lemma 29. 

Based on the above observation, we solve the problem as follows. We enumerate all maps \(\chi\nobreak\mskip 2.0mu\mathpunct{}\nonscript\mkern-3.0mu{:}\mskip 6.0mu plus 1.0muL\rightarrow\{0,1,\dots,h^{4}\}\) where \(\chi(l_{a})\)is the number of candidates from \(l_{a}\) in the committee. The total number of such maps is \(h^{O(h^{4})}\). For each feasible map, i.e., \(\chi\) satisfying \(\chi(l_{a})\leqslant|C\cap l_{a}|\)for all \(a\in[h^{4}]\), we construct a fault-tolerant committee \(T_{\chi}^{*}\)for \(V_{i,j}\)by picking (arbitrarily) \(\chi(l_{a})\)candidates in \(C\cap l_{a}\) for all \(a\in[h^{4}]\)and including them in \(T_{\chi}^{*}\). For each constructed \(T_{\chi}^{*}\), we compute a number \(\widetilde{\sigma_{f}}(T_{\chi}^{*})\)\(\widetilde{\sigma_{f}}(T_{\chi}^{*})\)that approximates \(\sigma_{f}(T_{\chi}^{*})\)using the following lemma. 

â–¶ **Lemma 30.** _ Given_ \(T_{\chi}^{*}\)_, one can compute a number_ \(\widetilde{\sigma_{f}}(T_{\chi}^{*})\)\(\widetilde{\sigma_{f}}(T_{\chi}^{*})\)_ in_ \(2^{O(h^{4})}n^{O(1)}\)_ time such that_ \(|\widetilde{\sigma_{f}}(T_{\chi}^{*})-\sigma_{f}(T_{\chi}^{*})|\leqslant 2/h\)_._ 

**Proof.**  For a pair of candidates \(c_{i},c_{j}\) in a cell \(l_{i}\in L\), we know \(d(c_{i},c_{j})\leqslant 2/h\). Since we want to compute the number \(\tilde{\sigma_{f}}(T_{\chi}^{*})\)\(\tilde{\sigma_{f}}(T_{\chi}^{*})\)within an absolute error of \(2/h\) compared to the actual value, it is sufficient to only consider the failing sets for which either all or none of the candidates from a cell fail. The total number of cells is \(h^{4}\); therefore, we only need to consider at most \(2^{O(h^{4})}\)distinct failing cells (see Figure 4). For each of these failing sets (say \(J\subseteq C\)), we
