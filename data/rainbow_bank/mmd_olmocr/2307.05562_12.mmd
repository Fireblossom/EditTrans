To investigate the possibility of stockouts at the warehouse level and their potential impact on store-level stockouts, we also analyze aggregate daily deliveries from the warehouse to all 634 stores. Given that the products in our working sample are popular items, we interpret a zero value in aggregate daily deliveries as a stockout event at the warehouse. The results of our analysis, presented in Section  A.4  in the Appendix, reveal that warehouse stockouts are negligible for our working sample. For each product within the working sample, warehouse stockout events occur on no more than 3 out of the 677 days in the sample, which accounts for less than \(0.5\%\) of the observed period. These findings suggest that stockouts observed at the store level are primarily driven by factors other than warehouse-level stockouts. 

### Data on store managers’ education and experience 

In addition to the main dataset, we enhance our analysis by incorporating information on store managers’ human capital. Leveraging the professional social networking platform _LinkedIn_ , we gather data on the education and experience of store managers from their public profiles. Out of the 634 store managers in our dataset, 600 are identifiable by name in the LCBO’s records. 7 7 During our sample period, some stores are overseen by interim managers who are not identified by name in our main dataset. Within this subset, we were able to locate public _ LinkedIn_  profiles for 143 managers, allowing us to retrieve valuable information about their educational background and work experience. 

Table  4  presents summary statistics for the variables related to store managers’ educational background and work experience. Notably, we observe a pattern in which managers with greater experience and higher educational attainment tend to be assigned to higherclassified stores. This finding suggests a positive correlation between manager characteristics and store classification, indicating that the LCBO may allocate more experienced and highly educated managers to stores of higher importance or larger scale. In Appendix  A.2 , we provide more detailed information on the positive relationship between manager characteristics and the classification of stores within the LCBO retail chain.
