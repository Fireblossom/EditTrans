## Conclusion 

We proposed an innovative framework for examining the impact of money growth on inflation and its disaggregate measures in the US and the Euro area. Our framework focuses on quantile dependence, providing a novel approach to analyze the distributional effects. This aspect of the relationship between money growth and inflation has not been previously explored in the existing literature. 

Through empirical analysis of both economies, we found evidence that variations in the upper quantile of the money growth distribution significantly influence the distribution of inflation and its disaggregate measures, affecting both its level and skewness. On the other hand, the lower and median quantiles of the money growth distribution exhibit a relatively negligible effect on the distribution of inflation. 

Our proposed framework is versatile and can be applied to investigate various other macroeconomic or financial phenomena. For instance, it can be extended to explore the relationship between oil prices and stock returns or a growth-at-risk scenario.
