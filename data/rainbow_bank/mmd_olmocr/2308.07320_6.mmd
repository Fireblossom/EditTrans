Augmented-Dickey Fuller Test where the null hypothesis is "the time series contains a unit root and is non-stationary". The results of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test for each of the Imputation datasets are given in the below sections. 

### Datasets Analysis and ADF test results 

The Figure below gives a plot of the whole dataset without dividing into train and test. 

The ADF test for no-imputation dataset test-statistic = -5.45 p-value = 2.55e-06 for no-imputation dataset for first difference to try to change the time-series to stationary. test-statistic = -10.403 p-value = 1.88e-18 for Second Difference, which is not suggested as the p-value is zero (over-differencing) test-statistic = -21.152 p-value = 0.0 

This figure below depicts the Mean Imputation dataset Plot. 

The ADF test for Mean imputation dataset test-statistic = -5.393 p-value = 3.49e-06 for first difference to try to change the time-series to stationary. test-statistic = -10.073 p-value = 1.23e-17 for Second Difference, which is not suggested as the p-value is zero (over-differencing) test-statistic = -21.617 p-value = 0.0
