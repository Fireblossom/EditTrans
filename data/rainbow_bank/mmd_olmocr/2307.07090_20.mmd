**Note:**  This table presents the bias and variance of cross-elasticity when there are inattentive consumers. We simulate the market share of each product in each market by assuming there is a portion of consumers who ignore the product with the highest price. We assume the portion is \(1-\frac{1}{1+Price_{j}}\). We consider 3 scenarios with 2, 5, and 10 products respectively. We fix the number of markets to 100 and the number of features to 1 (with only price). Other parts are the same as RCL in our baseline. 

due to its structural constraints on the input space. We use two data generation processes ‚Äì Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Random-Coefficients Logit (RCL). The observable characteristics of the new product are simulated using the same distribution as other products. In Table  10 , we present the estimated market share of the new product. Our model outperforms the MNL when the underlying data generation process is RCL, and produces results comparable to the true model.

**Note:**  This table presents the bias and variance of predicted market shares of all products in the market when a new product enters. We simulate market shares as in our baseline scenario (10 products, 100 markets, 10 features) when a new product is introduced. 

### Inference and Coverage Analysis 

Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the inference procedure. The objective is to demonstrate the validity of the estimated confidence intervals. To this end, we estimate the effect of a 1% change in price on demand and compute the corresponding confidence intervals of this effect. To simulate the data, we consider a random-coefficients logit model of demand with 3 products across 100 markets. We set the true model parameters to be \(\beta_{ik}\sim\mathcal{N}(1,0.5),\alpha_{i}\sim\mathcal{N}(-1,0.5)\). The effect of a 1 increase in a product‚Äôs price is given by Œ∏0=ùîº[m(wi,œÄ]=ùîº[œÄ(pj‚Å¢t‚àó(1.01),xj‚Å¢t,{xk‚Å¢t}k‚â†j)‚àíœÄ(pj‚Å¢t,xj‚Å¢t,{xk‚Å¢t}k‚â†j)],  As discussed earlier, one way to estimate this effect is to compute the sample analog of this
