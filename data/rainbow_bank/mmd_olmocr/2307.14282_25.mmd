We construct Figure 1 to provide additional evidence of strategic behavior. Consider a program \(j\) with cutoff \(c_{j}\). Suppose, (consistently with the general finding of the empirical literature on college choice), that students tend to prefer programs of higher quality. If applicants behave strategically, one would expect applications to program \(j\) to peak among students with application score close to \(c_{j}\). If cutoffs tend to remain in the same neighborhood across years, students with application scores much higher than \(c_{j}\) can expect to be admissible to more selective, higher-quality programs than \(j\), which they prefer over \(j\). Hence, we expect very few of these students to include \(j\) in their list. As application scores get lower and closer to \(c_{j}\), students’ admission chances to the most selective programs decrease, and program \(j\) becomes one of the most selective (desirable) program among those they still have a high admission probability. Hence, we expect applications to \(c_{j}\) to increase as application scores decrease and get closer to \(c_{j}\). As application scores decrease below \(c_{j}\), students realize that their admission probability to program \(j\) gets lower, and while program \(j\) remains a relatively desirable (selective) alternative, we expect these expectations to drive applications down. This application pattern, expected if students behave strategically, is exactly what we observe on the top panel of Figure 1. Pooling all programs \(j\) together, the top panel of Figure 1 shows the fraction of students listing program \(j\) in their rank-order lists (ROL or \(P\) in terms of our notation), as a function of the distance between their application for program \(j\) and the cutoff \(c_{j}\). 

It may be difficult to disentangle the role of preferences from the role of expectations about admission probabilities when both may enter students’ choice of which programs to include in their ROLs (Manski (2004); Agarwal and Somaini (2018)). The pattern observed in the top panel of Figure 1 could, alternatively, be consistent with students not behaving strategically but preferring programs that “are a good fit in terms of quality”, that is, programs in which their skill level would be close to the average skill level. If that is the case, applications should peak among students whose skills (proxied by application score) are close to the mean skill level in the program. This is not what we observe in the bottom panel of Figure 1. Pooling all programs \(j\) together, the bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the fraction of students including program \(j\) in their list, as a function of the distance between their application for program \(j\) and the mean application score among students admitted to \(j\). Conditional on application score, the share of students applying to a program \(j\) is not the highest for application scores close to the mean score among students admitted to \(j\). It reaches its highest point well below this level, showing that students do not systematically prefer programs in which they would be the “average” student. This further confirms the hypothesis that students behave strategically. 

### Results 

Regardless of strategic behavior, the aggregation of treatment effects across different programs brings additional challenges not tackled in this paper; therefore, to more clearly illustrate the importance of accounting for strategic behavior, we focus on a single program. We are interested in identifying the effects of assignment to a given post-secondary program on college graduation.
