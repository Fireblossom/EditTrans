Figure 3.3: The income-equality curve \(\psi_{3}\)and the shaded-in area (i.e., \(\Psi_{3}\)) above it for the distributions of Table  3.1 , with the dash-dotted line depicting \(\psi_{3}\) of the uniform distribution. 

distributions for modelling incomes (see, e.g.,  Kleiber and Kotz ,  2003 ), and one of them is the Dagum distribution. For statistical inference for the ratio of any two quantiles of this distribution – and the three equality curves \(\psi_{k}(p)\)are such ratios – we refer to  J¸edrzejczak et al.  ( 2023 ).
