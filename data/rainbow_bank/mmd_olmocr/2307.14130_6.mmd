states. As shown in Fig. 8 (c) and (d), the qubit gradually relaxes to \(\left|0\right\rangle\)after the SFQ operation. Therefore, when the \(\pi\) pulse is applied to the qubit immediately after the SFQ operation, the qubit cannot be completely excited to the \(\left|1\right\rangle\)state. As the recovery time prolongs, the population of \(\left|1\right\rangle\)after the \(\pi\) pulse also gradually increases to 1. 

## Appendix C: Extraction of Quasiparticle Density Near Qubit 

The \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) extracted using \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}=(\Gamma(t)-\Gamma_{0})/{C}\) is a kind of average QP density during the \(T_{1}\)measurement, which can be regarded as the average density of QP over a period of time \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\) ( \(\sim\,T_{1}\)) after \(t_{\mathrm{R}}\). To intuitively illustrate the validity of the \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) evolution extracted in this way to analyze the QP propagation mechanism, we compare (i) the \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) extracted with a very short measurement time ( \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\,=\,0\)) in an ideal measurement, and (ii) the \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) extracted with several microsecond measurement times ( \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}=3,\ 6,\ 12,\ 18\ \mu s\)) in a real experiment. We assume that the gray curve ( \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\,=0\)) in the Fig. 9 below, which is similar to the trend of the extracted \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) evolution in the maintext, is the real QP density evolution. The trends and timescales ( \(\sim\)several microseconds) of \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) evolution vary little over all values of \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\) listed.

## Appendix D: Diffusion of Quasiparticles in Superconducting Quantum-Classical Hybrid Circuits 

Most QPs propagate diffusively when the local QP density is relatively low. The local QP density is \(x_{\mathrm{QP}}=n_{\mathrm{QP}}/n_{\mathrm{CP}}\), where \(n_{\mathrm{QP}}\) is the QP density and \(n_{\mathrm{CP}}\)the Cooper pair density. As the local QP density increases, QPs have a greater probability of recombination, and phonon-mediated propagation becomes the leading mechanism. We calculated the diffusion equation by finite element simulation, thereby estimating the contribution of QP diffusion to the QP propagation in the device described in the paper. We set a boundary of
