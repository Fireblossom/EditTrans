\(\hat{\eta}\)\(\hat{\eta}\)-pseudo-Hermitian: \(\hat{\mathscr{L}}^{{\dagger}}(x^{\eta})=\hat{\eta}\hat{\mathscr{L}}(x)\hat{ \eta}^{-1}\)\(\hat{\mathscr{L}}^{{\dagger}}(x^{\eta})=\hat{\eta}\hat{\mathscr{L}}(x)\hat{ \eta}^{-1}\). 

In the case of non-interacting theories, the kinetic and diagonal mass terms  \(\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)\hat{\varphi}(x)\)\(\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)\hat{\varphi}(x)\)\(\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)\hat{\varphi}(x)\)are both Poincar´e invariant and \(\hat{\eta}\)\(\hat{\eta}\)-pseudo-Hermitian. More generally, however, we can include a mass mixing. In this case, there will be a non-diagonal mass term of the from  \(\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)A\hat{\varphi}(x)\)\(\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)A\hat{\varphi}(x)\)\(\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)A\hat{\varphi}(x)\), where \(A\) is a \(n\times n\) non-diagonal matrix. Under the action of the proper Poincar´e group, we have 

\[\text{I}\text{SO}(1,3)^{\uparrow}:\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)A\hat{ \varphi}(x)\mapsto\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(\Lambda^{-1}(x-\varepsilon ))[D^{-1}(\Lambda)AD(\Lambda)]\hat{\varphi}(\Lambda^{-1}(x-\varepsilon))\;.\  

For \(n\)-component scalars/pseudo-scalars, the \(n\)-dimensional proper Lorentz transformation is just the \(n\times n\) identity matrix, i.e., 

\[D(\Lambda)=\matrixquantity(D_{00}(\Lambda)&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&D_{00}(\Lambda)&&\\ \vdots&&\ddots&\\ 0&&&D_{00}(\Lambda))=\mathbbm{1}_{n}\  

Hence, the mass mixing terms are Poincar´e invariant. 

However, the mixing term is \(\hat{\eta}\)\(\hat{\eta}\)-pseudo-Hermitian: 

\[(\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x^{\eta})A\hat{\varphi}(x^{\eta}))^{{ \dagger}}=\hat{\eta}\quantity[\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)\Pi^{-1}A^{{ \dagger}}\Pi\hat{\varphi}(x)]\hat{\eta}^{-1}=\hat{\eta}\quantity[\hat{\tilde{ \varphi}}^{{\dagger}}(x)A\hat{\varphi}(x)]\hat{\eta}\;,\  

if only if \(A^{{\dagger}}=\Pi A\Pi^{-1}\)\(\Pi\)-pseudo-Hermitian. This places restrictions on the matrix \(\Pi\). 

In Sect. 6, we study an example of this type of Lagrangian. We consider a two-component scalar field with mass mixing term of the form \(\hat{\mathscr{L}}(x)=\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}_{1}(x)\hat{\varphi}^{2} (x)-\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}_{2}(x)\hat{\varphi}^{1}(x)\)\(\hat{\mathscr{L}}(x)=\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}_{1}(x)\hat{\varphi}^{2} (x)-\hat{\tilde{\varphi}}^{{\dagger}}_{2}(x)\hat{\varphi}^{1}(x)\). If we write it in matrix form, the non-diagonal mass mixing matrix is: 

\[A=\matrixquantity(0&1\\ -1&0)\;.\  

The matrix \(A\)\(\Pi\)-pseudo-Hermitian IFF \(\pi_{2}=-\pi_{1}\)\(\Pi\)to the form: 

\[\Pi\propto\matrixquantity(1&0\\ 0&-1)\;.\  

In the example, this is a parity matrix that reflects the intrinsic parities of a scalar component \(\hat{\varphi}^{1}\)\(\hat{\varphi}^{1}\)and a pseudo-scalar component \(\hat{\varphi}^{2}\)\(\hat{\varphi}^{2}\)in the two-component scalar field \(\hat{\varphi}=\matrixquantity(\hat{\varphi}^{1}\\ \hat{\varphi}^{2})\)\(\hat{\varphi}=\matrixquantity(\hat{\varphi}^{1}\\ \hat{\varphi}^{2})\).
