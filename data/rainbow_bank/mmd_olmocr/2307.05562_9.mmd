frequently in smaller stores than in larger ones within our working sample. The average _ D_ store experiences \(0.56\) stockout events per week, while the average _ AAA_  store encounters \(0.14\)stockout events per week. Delivery patterns in our working sample follow a similar trend to Table  1 , with larger stores placing larger and more frequent orders. The average _ AAA_  store receives deliveries 4 days per week, totaling 272 units per week, whereas the average _ D_  store only receives deliveries 0.6 days per week, amounting to 15 units per week.

Figure  1  shows strong heterogeneity across stores in several measures related to inventory management of the five products in our working sample. The figures in panels (a) to (f) are inverse cumulative distributions over stores, together with their \(95\%\) confidence bands. 6 6 For every store, the \(95\%\) confidence interval is based on the construction of store-product-specific rates. The \(95\%\) confidence interval is determined by percentiles \(2.5\%\) and \(97.5\%\) in this distribution.
