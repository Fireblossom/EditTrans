The datasets used in this study are collected by NYCTLC 2 2 In 2009, NYCTLC initiated the Taxi Passenger Enhancement Project, which mandated the use of upgraded metering and information technology in all New York medallion cabs. , which include both trip-level and aggregated shift-level information. The trip-level data contain the daily average yellow/green taxi trips, average trip duration, vendor ID, pickup and drop-off timestamps and locations (zonal level), trip distance, number of passengers, trip fare, tip, extra surcharges 3 3 These are miscellaneous extras and surcharges, and currently include $0.50 and $1 rush hour and overnight in rush hour or overnight, improvement surcharge 4 charges. 4 The improvement surcharge began being levied in 2015, and $0.30 improvement surcharge assessed trips at the , tax, and tolls.

In the lack of individual shift-level data, we use the aggregated shift-level data in the study. The aggregated shift-level data are monthly based and are processed from approximately 8.32 billion yellow taxi trips, 0.73 billion green taxi trips, and 6.55 billion TNC trips over six years (January 2013 to December 2018). The data are obtained at the average individual-level and market-level. The average individual-level data cover daily average work hours per yellow/green taxi driver, daily average income per yellow/green driver, daily average yellow/green taxi medallions, monthly average active days per medallion. The average market-level data include the daily average fare of yellow/green taxis (include tips from credit card), monthly yellow/green taxi drivers, monthly yellow/green taxi medallions, total monthly work hours of all yellow/green taxi medallions and taxi drivers. We calculate the monthly income per driver by dividing the total fare per month by the monthly number of drivers. The data applied in our analysis can be seen in Table 1.
