following conditional expected payoff function for any given individual \(i\in N\): 14 14 

\[EU_{V}(r|\gamma_{i},\delta,t,F,\phi)=\begin{cases}-\gamma_{i}+r\cdot\rho( \delta,\phi)(1-F(r\cdot\rho(\delta,\phi)))+t\cdot F(r\cdot\rho(\delta,\phi))\, \,\,\text{ if }\gamma_{i}\leq r\cdot\rho(\delta,\phi),\\ -r\cdot\rho(\delta,\phi)F(r\cdot\rho(\delta,\phi))+t\cdot F(r\cdot\rho(\delta, \phi))\,\,\,\text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}\] (9)  

The following proposition establishes that each individual’s maximization problem is wellEquation (9) is derived in Appendix B (Equations (20) and (21)). defined. 

**Proposition 5.** _ If_ \(\delta\)_ is not null, then conditional on behavior_ \(\beta_{i}\)_, voter payoffs are strictly quasi-_ _concave in rewards,_ \(r\)_, and maximized at an interior_ \(r\)_. If_ \(\delta\)_ is null, each voter_ \(i\)_ is indifferent_ _between all reward levels._ 

The following corollary presents the two potentially optimal rewards for any individual \(i\) (one conditional on \(i\) subsequently choosing to comply, and the other conditional on \(i\) subsequently choosing to not comply). 

**Corollary 1.** _ The optimal_ \(r_{1}^{*}\)_and_ \(r_{0}^{*}\)_(rewards for individuals choosing to comply and not comply_ _respectively) are of the form:_ 

\[r_{\beta_{i}}^{*}(\delta\mid t,F,\phi)=\frac{k_{j}^{*}(t,F)}{\rho(\delta,\phi) }\;\;\;\forall\beta_{i}\in\{0,1\},\] (10)  

_with the values_ \(k_{0}^{*}(t,F)\)_ and_ \(k_{1}^{*}(t,F)\)_ defined implicitly as follows:_ 

\[k_{0}^{*}(t,F) = t-\frac{F(k_{0}^{*}(t,F))}{f(k_{0}^{*}(t,F))},\] \[\vspace{.1in}k_{1}^{*}(t,F) = t+\frac{1-F(k_{1}^{*}(t,F))}{f(k_{1}^{*}(t,F))}.\]  

Corollary 1 shows that, for any given \(\delta\), \(t\), \(F\), and \(\phi\), there are only two possible ideal rewards \(r_{0}^{*}\)or \(r_{1}^{*}\)— for any given individual \(i\). Furthermore, _ these two possible ideal reward levels are_ _identical across all individuals_ . This is the combined result of the assumption of budget balance and the assumption that all individuals have a common marginal preference for compliance by others ( \(t\) is common to all). That said, what is especially surprising about this is that individuals are not homogeneous — they each know their own types.
