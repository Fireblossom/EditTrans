and identification of entanglement have profound significance. The identification of entangled states, in particular, presents a formidable challenge, underscored by its classification as an NP-Hard problem in mathematical terms [12]. Hence, the pursuit of viable techniques for detecting entangled states takes on paramount importance. 

Entangled states are referred to as states that are not separable, and separable states refer to states that can be written as follows [13]: 

\[\rho=\sum p_{i}|\psi_{i}\rangle\langle\psi_{i}|\otimes|\phi_{i}\rangle\langle \phi_{i}|.\] (1)  

Here, \(|\psi_{i}\rangle\)__and \(|\phi_{i}\rangle\)__denote pure states, with \(0\leq p_{i}\leq 1\)__and \(\sum p_{i}=1\)__. One strategy for identifying entanglement involves investigating whether a state can be expressed in the aforementioned form. This, however, poses a formidable challenge. As a result, there is a pressing need for more effective methodologies for the detection of entanglement. Over time, diverse techniques have emerged for this purpose. Among these, entanglement witnesses (EW), introduced by the Horodecki family in 1996, have gained recognition as one of the most useful and valuable approaches [14]. 

Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are defined as non-positive operators whose expectation values remain non-negative on all separable states. Mathematically, this concept is encapsulated by the criterion that a Hermitian operator \(W\)__ qualifies as an EW if it satisfies the condition: 

\[\operatorname{Tr}(W\sigma)\geq 0,\quad\forall\sigma\in S,\] (2)  

in which \(S\)__ is the set of all separable states (see [15] for a recent review on EWs). This equation means \(W\)__ is a block-positive operator, i.e. \[\langle\psi,\phi|W|\psi,\phi\rangle,\ \forall\psi\in H_{1},\forall\phi\in H_{2}.\]  However, constructing EWs is not a straightforward task, and appropriate methods need to be proposed for this purpose. 

One effective approach to constructing EW involves harnessing positive maps. Positive maps have a direct correspondence with EWs, characterized by the following relation [14] 

\[W(M)=(I\otimes M)|\phi^{+}\rangle\langle\phi^{+}|,\] (3)
