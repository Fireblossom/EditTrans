promised epistemic benefits of democracy, we would need to make the decisionprocedures used in actual democracies a lot more inclusive and a lot more egalitarian than they are at present. Institutional reforms that the argument points toward include the replacement of elected representatives with randomly selected ones and a greater use of simple majoritarian decision-making. 

While the argument is not explicitly stated 6 6 Despite claiming that ’The argument presented here is based on a simple model of democracy and is entirely deductive,’ the precise premises, intermediary steps, and conclusions are never explicitly stated. This should be the first step in , a crucial hypothesis needed for the theorem assumes the following forms: constructing the argument and possible replies. 

_•_ _ Hypothesis_ , \(H\): Cognitive diversity, defined as individuals seeing problems and making predictions based on different models of the world, is a group property that improves group performance in various contexts. _•_ _ Hypothesis’_ , \(H^{\prime}\): Greater cognitive diversity within a group correlates with better problemsolving and prediction abilities. 

To justify this, Landemore relies on the results of Hong and Page as described above [ 5 ]: 

To make that claim, I essentially rely on Hong and Page’s formal results about the centrality of cognitive diversity to the emergent property of collective intelligence. 

We aim to demonstrate that this hypothesis is unjustified, which subsequently renders the argument both logically unsound and inapplicable to real-world scenarios. Additionally, we will highlight instances where she incorrectly deduces propositions from these mathematical theorems, leading to a logically invalid argument. 

**Remark 6.1.**  Some of the critiques presented in the previous section also apply to Landemore. For instance, when she informally discusses the theorem, she falls into the same misrepresentation as Hong and Page, as discussed in Section  5.2 . For instance, she stated in a public  debate : 

There are multiple Hong-Page theorems. The one that I use mostly is the ’Diversity Trumps Ability’ theorem. It’s basically a formalization of the idea that under certain conditions, you’re better off solving problems with a group of average people who think differently than with a group of experts or very smart people. 

As we have previously illustrated, this assertion is entirely false, see Section  5.2  and below for more details. 

### Basic misunderstanding of the mathematical theorems 

6.2. 

.  Landemore says (about the Theorem 1.7 ): 

Let me pause here to emphasize what a remarkably ** counterintuitive** , indeed amazing, result his is. Where the conditions apply, you are better off with a ** random** **group of people who think differently than with a bunch of Einsteins** ! Who would have thought? In my view, this result should truly change our perspective on what makes groups smart to begin with; I believe it has huge implications for the way we should think about political bodies making decisions on our behalf. _(emphasis added)_ 

Also [ 5 ], 

That theorem was sufficiently counterintuitive that they provided a computational example to provide intuition.
