true. In this sense, as in Sandholm (2002, 2005), we need not impose that players play an equilibrium of the game but could depart from more primitive assumptions on players’ strategic sophistication by requiring that none play a strategy that is iteratively dominated. Equilibrium play would then be obtained as a result, rather than an assumption, of the analysis. 

Section 5 presents the building blocks of this result and develops some of the intuition. It also discusses the properties of \(\tilde{s}\)\(\tilde{s}\) and compares those to other proposals in the literature. 

## Analysis 

The plan for this section is as follows. We first show that for any vector of subsidies \(s\) there exists a unique vector of real numbers \(x(s)=(x_{i}(s))\)such that the increasing strategy vector \(p^{x(s)}\)is the unique strategy vector that survives IESDS in \({\mathit{\oldGamma}}^{\varepsilon}(s)\). Then we demonstrate that the strategy vector \(p^{x(s)}\)is also the unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium of \({\mathit{\oldGamma}}^{\varepsilon}(s)\). We use this, and some minor technical results, to derive the unique subsidy scheme \(\tilde{s}\)\(\tilde{s}\) that implements \(p^{\tilde{x}}\). 

The analysis relies on two monotonicity properties of players’ expected incentives for much of the heavy lifting. 

**Lemma 1.** _ Given is a vector of real numbers_ \(y=(y_{i})\)_ and the associated increasing strategy_ _vector_ \(p^{y}=(p_{i}^{y_{i}})\)_. Then,_ 

\(u^{\varepsilon}_{i}(p_{-i}^{y}\mid x_{i}^{\varepsilon})\)_ is monotone increasing in_ \(x_{i}^{\varepsilon}\)_;_ \(u^{\varepsilon}_{i}(p_{-i}^{y}\mid x_{i}^{\varepsilon})\)_ is monotone decreasing in_ \(y_{j}\)_, all_ \(j\in\mathscr{N}\setminus\{i\}\)_._ 

Part (i) of Lemma 1 says that a player’s incentive to play 1 is increasing in his type \(x_{i}^{\varepsilon}\)when his opponents play increasing strategies. There are two sides to this. First, taking as given the vector of actions \(a_{-i}\), a player’s expected payoff to playing 1 is linearly increasing in \(x_{i}^{\varepsilon}\); hence, his expected incentive is increasing in his signal \(x_{i}^{\varepsilon}\). Second, as \(x_{i}^{\varepsilon}\)increases player \(i\)’s posterior distribution on the hidden state \(x\) and, therefore, the signals of his opponents
