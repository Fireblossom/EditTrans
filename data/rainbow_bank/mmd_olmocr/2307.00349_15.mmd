equilibrium is unique by Proposition  3 , under the conditions in Theorem  1 , there are no equilibria in which the land price equals its fundamental value. 

Theorem  1  has three important implications. First, it clarifies the role of unbalanced growth and elasticity of substitution for generating land overvaluation, which was previously overlooked. Regarding the assumption of elasticity of substitution between land and non-land exceeding 1, we justify it on empirical and theoretical grounds as discussed in Section  3.2 . 

Second, we can derive a new insight on the long-run behavior of land prices in a modern economy. The conventional view is that on the long-run trend, the land price should reflect its fundamental value, even if it may deviate from the fundamental value temporarily. In sharp contrast with this widely-held view, Theorem  1  implies that during the process of economic development characterized by unbalanced productivity growth, land overvaluation will naturally and necessarily arise. 6 6 Of course, if $G_H=G_X$ holds in the long run, which is often assumed to ensure a balanced 

Before discussing the third implication in Section growth path in the growth literature, there will be no overvaluation in land prices but this is  3.4 , we show that all examples in Section obviously a knife-edge case.  2  are special cases of Theorem  1 . 

**Corollary 2.** _ Proposition_ _ 2_ _ is true._ 

_Proof._  Define the aggregate production function by 

\begin{equation*}     F_t(H,X)=A_{1t}H_1H+A_{2t}(H_2H)^\alpha X^{1-\alpha}, \end{equation*}

where $H_1,H_2>0$are constants. Define 

\begin{align*}     F(H,X)&=H_2H+H_2^\alpha H^\alpha X^{1-\alpha},\\     (A_{Ht},A_{Xt})&=(A_{1t},(A_{2t}/A_{1t}^\alpha)^\frac{1}{1-\alpha}). \end{align*}

Then clearly $F_t(H,X)=F(A_{Ht}H,A_{Xt}X)$and Assumption  holds. Assumption 2  holds by Example  3 . If $A_{jt}=G_j^t$with $G_1>G_2$, then 

\begin{equation*}     A_{Ht}/A_{Xt}=(A_{1t}/A_{2t})^\frac{1}{1-\alpha}=(G_1/G_2)^\frac{t}{1-\alpha}, \end{equation*}

so ( 3.7 ) holds.
