coins are \(n_{k,0}\) with \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}n_{k,0}=N\). We define the _ share_  as the fraction of coins each miner owns. So the initial shares \((\pi_{k,0},\,k\in[K])\)are given by 

\[\pi_{k,0}:=\frac{n_{k,0}}{N},\quad k\in[K].\  

Similarly, denote by \(n_{k,t}\) the number of coins owned by miner \(k\) at time \(t\), and the corresponding share is 

\[\pi_{k,t}:=\frac{n_{k,t}}{N_{t}},\quad k\in[K],\quad\mbox{with }N_{t}:=\sum_{k =1}^{K}n_{k,t}.\  

Here \(N_{t}\) is the total number of coins at time \(t\), with \(N_{0}=N\). (We shall often refer to \(N_{t}\) as the “volume of coins”, or simply “volume”.) 

At time \(t\), miner \(k\) is selected at random with probability \(\pi_{k,t-1}\). Once selected, the miner receives a deterministic reward of \(R_{t}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}\) coins (which may include transaction fees and block rewards). Denote by \(S_{k,t}\) the random event that miner \(k\) is selected at time \(t\). So the number of coins owned by each miner evolves as 

\[n_{k,t}=n_{k,t-1}+R_{t}1_{S_{k,t}},\quad k\in[K].\  

Note that the volume satisfies \(N_{t}=N_{t-1}+R_{t}\). Combining (2.2) and (2.3) yields a recursion of the shares: 

\[\pi_{k,t}=\frac{N_{t-1}}{N_{t}}\pi_{k,t-1}+\frac{R_{t}}{N_{t}}1_{S_{k,t}}, \quad k\in[K].\  

which is a (time-dependent) P´olya urn model [26]. 

We consider the long-time evolution of the shares \((\pi_{k,t},\,k\in[K])\). Let \(\mathcal{F}_{t}\) be the filtration generated by the random events \((S_{k,r}:k\in[K],r\leqslant t)\). Observe that for each \(k\in[K]\), the process \((\pi_{k,t},\,t\geqslant 0)\)is an \(\mathcal{F}_{t}\)-martingale. By the martingale convergence theorem (see [15, Theorem 4.2.11]), 

\[(\pi_{1,t},\ldots,\pi_{K,t})\longrightarrow(\pi_{1,\infty},\ldots,\pi_{K, \infty})\quad\mbox{as }t\rightarrow\infty\mbox{ with probability }1,\  

where \((\pi_{1,\infty},\ldots,\pi_{K,\infty})\)is some random probability distribution on \([K]\). 

To quantify the wealth evolution of miner \(k\), there are two obvious metrics: 

\[|\pi_{k,t}-\pi_{k,0}|\mbox{ (difference)}\quad\mbox{and}\quad\frac{\pi_{k,t}}{ \pi_{k,0}}\mbox{ (ratio)}.\  

If \(|\pi_{k,t}-\pi_{k,0}|\)\(0\), or \(\frac{\pi_{k,t}}{\pi_{k,0}}\)\(1\)(as \(t\) is large), we say that the share \(\pi_{k,t}\) is _stable_  or _ concentrated_ . This is the desired case as it implies that the PoS protocol will not lead to centralisation. Note that if \(\pi_{k,t}\) is of constant order, there is no difference in considering \(|\pi_{k,t}-\pi_{k,0}|\) or \(\pi_{k,t}/\pi_{k,0}\). However, when \(\pi_{k,t}\) is small, the two metrics may exhibit different results: \(|\pi_{k,t}-\pi_{k,0}|\)is (trivially) close to \(0\)( \(0-0\)), while \(\pi_{k,t}/\pi_{k,0}\)is indeterminate ( \(0/0\)). 

First, assume that \(R_{t}\equiv R\)(constant reward), where the limiting \((\pi_{1,\infty},\ldots,\pi_{K,\infty})\)can be identified. Let \(\Gamma(z):=\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{z-1}e^{-x}dx\) be the Gamma function. Recall that the Dirichlet distribution with parameters \((a_{1},\ldots,a_{K})\), which we denote by \(\operatorname{Dir}(a_{1},\ldots,a_{K})\), has support on the standard simplex \(\{(x_{1},\ldots,x_{K})\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{K}:\sum_{k=1}^{K}x_{k}=1\}\) and has density: 

\[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{K})=\frac{\Gamma\left(\sum_{k=1}^{K}a_{k}\right)}{\prod_{k=1 }^{K}\Gamma(a_{k})}\prod_{k=1}^{K}x_{k}^{a_{k}-1}.\
