FIG. 11. (a) Pauli stabilizer terms of the X-cube model. The model is defined on a cubic lattice and qubits live on the edges. The X stabilizer term is associated with the cube and the Z stabilizer terms are associated with the vertices. (b) Sequential circuit for X-cube model (of height \(L_{z}=2\)cubes) with smooth boundaries at the top and bottom and periodic boundaries on the sides. Left: We start with \(L_{z}=2\)layers of Toric Code (shown in orange) with periodic boundary conditions in the layer directions and a layer of trivial qubits in state \(\ket{0}\)(shown in purple). We add trivial qubits in state \(\ket{+}\)on the vertical edges; the dots on the vertical edges are not shown for clarity. Right: On each vertical plaquette, we perform CNOT gates as shown using arrows that go from control to target qubits. We first do these gates as shown in parallel on all the top layer vertical plaquettes, then we do the layer below it, and so on. In the figure, we have \(L_{z}=2\), hence our circuit has depth 2 as shown on the right. (c) Sequential circuit to convert X-cube model with smooth boundaries into an X-cube model on a torus. We add a layer of qubits on vertical edges in state \(\ket{+}\)above the top smooth boundary (the top orange layer) such that we can join to the bottom smooth boundary (the bottom orange layer) via these vertical edges to impose periodic boundary conditions; the dots on the vertical edges are not shown for clarity. In one step of the sequential circuit, all qubits on the vertical edges in the same color are used as control qubits. The CNOT gates from each of these control qubits have target qubits on the edges of a single cube. An example is shown on the right. The CNOT gates are shown using arrows that go from control to target qubits. 

a sequential circuit of depth \(\mathcal{O}(L_{z})\)to combine them into an X-cube model of height \(\mathcal{O}(L_{z})\)cubes and with smooth boundaries (Fig.  11b ). 

The same circuit can be used to prepare the X-cube model with periodic boundary condition in the vertical direction with fewer starting trivial qubits. To be specific, under periodic boundary conditions, the layer of trivial qubits shown in purple is not needed along the vertical direction and the orange layer at the bottom will connect to the top orange layer. The entangling gates as shown in Fig.  11b  will then prepare the X-cube model on a 3-torus. 

However, if we first prepare the height \(L_{z}\) X-cube model with smooth boundaries and then convert it to the X-cube model on a 3-torus with height \(L_{z}+1\)by doing local gates at the top layer, we need a sequential circuit as shown in Fig.  11c . We add a layer of trivial qubits on vertical edges above the top smooth boundary in state \(\ket{+}\); these vertical edges now connect to the bottom smooth boundary due to periodic boundary conditions. Using these vertical qubits as control qubits, we do CNOT gates sequentially to prepare the layer of cube stabilizers. The CNOT gates that are applied in parallel are specified by the choice of the control qubits shown on the vertical edges with the same color and along the diagonal (left of Fig.  11c ) and by the gates shown (right of Fig.  11c ). Thus, to convert the X-cube model with smooth boundaries into a 3-torus, we need a sequential circuit of depth \(\mathcal{O}(L_{x}+L_{y})\)(Fig. ). 

A generalization of the X-cube model is the Ising cage-net model which is obtained from a coupled layer construction of double-Ising string-net models instead of Toric Code layers [ 35 ]. In Ref.  25 , a generalized notion of foliation and a sequential circuit for preparation of the Ising Cage-net model is presented. For the X-cube model, the resource Toric Code layers can be prepared in parallel before being inserted one by one into the bulk to increase the size of the X-cube model. For Ising Cage-net, however, this is not possible. Using the scheme presented in Ref.  25 , a thin slab (of small \(L_{z}\)) of Ising Cage-net can first be prepared with \(\mathcal{O}(L_{x}+L_{y})\)steps. Then the height of the slab \(L_{z}\) can be increased one at a time, each time requiring a circuit of depth \(\mathcal{O}(L_{x}+L_{y})\). Therefore, overall a quadratic ( \(\mathcal{O}(L^{2})\)) depth circuit is needed to generate the Ising Cage-net model. 

Whether one can do better than quadratic circuit depth for the Ising cage-net model is left as an open question. It will also be interesting to construct sequential circuit maps for more general fracton models such as the type-2 fracton models which have fractalshaped logical operators [ 32 ]. 

### p-string condensation circuit for X-cube model 

We now construct a linear-depth sequential circuit for the preparation of the X-cube model using p-string condensation [ 34 ,  35 ]. We first consider three decoupled stacks of Toric Codes in \(xy\), \(yz\), and \(zx\) planes such that a part of this stack \(z>L\) has undergone p-string condensation. That is, \(Z-Z\) stabilizers have been added to the double edges of the 3-foliated stack lattice for \(z>L\)
