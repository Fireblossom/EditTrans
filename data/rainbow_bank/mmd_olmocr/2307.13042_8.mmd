Figure 7. (a)-(c): Dynamics of the bound state probability (BSP) with \(\theta{=}\pi/6\), \(\phi{=}2\pi/3\), for \(N{=}3\)photons (a), \(N{=}4\)(b) and \(N{=}5\)(c), at fixed system size \(L{=}300{+}150\). Data is obtained using TEBD with bond dimension \(\chi{=}256\)and open boundary conditions. (d) Time average of the BSP over 100 cycles using TEBD and extrapolated to \(L{\to}\infty\). We also averaged over two inequivalent initial states ( 7 ). Inset: Average BSP for different photon numbers \(N\) at fixed \(L{=}300{+}150\). Data was averaged over 150 cycles and obtained using TEBD with bond dimension \(\chi=320\)for \(3\leqslant N\leqslant 12\), \(\theta=\pi/6\), \(\phi=2\pi/3\)and varying \(\theta^{\prime}\). (e) Diagonal ensemble prediction for the probability to remain in a bound state, averaged over two possible initial configurations. Data in this panel is obtained using ED with PBCs, on system sizes \(N{=}3\), \(L{=}30{+}15\)(with Hilbert space dimension \(\mathrm{dim}{=}14189\)); \(N{=}4\), \(L{=}20{+}10\)( \(\mathrm{dim}{=}27404\)); \(N{=}5\), \(L{=}14{+}7\)( \(\mathrm{dim}{=}20348\)); \(N{=}6\), \(L{=}12{+}6\)( \(\mathrm{dim}{=}18563\)).  Inset: Extrapolation to infinite system size for a translation invariant initial configuration with \(k{=}0\)momentum. 

simulations become computationally more expensive as the evolution time increases, which limits the total number of cycles. On the other hand, the diagonal ensemble prediction provides information about the BSP at infinite time, however, it requires a computation of the complete eigenspectrum using ED, which limits the maximal system size. The total Hilbert space size is constrained by the amount of RAM available for diagonalization, while our implementation relies on 128-bit integers to represent basis configurations, which limits the maximal number of sites \(L\leqslant 128\), irrespective of the photon number \(N\). In principle, the latter restriction can be lifted using a more flexible encoding of the basis states, at the cost of sacrificing some of the computation efficiency. 

For the TEBD time average of the BSP, we consider \(100\)cycles between cycle \(n_{c}=20\)and cycle \(n_{c}=120\)for a variety of system sizes ranging from \(L=20+10\)to \(L=300+150\). In this way, we exclude the data at very short times which may be impacted by non-universal effects. By fitting the average BSP at each system size according to \(\mathrm{BSP}(L,\theta^{\prime})=\alpha(1/L)+\mathrm{BSP}_{\infty}\)we extrapolate to \(L\rightarrow\infty\)and obtain the result plotted in Fig.  7 (d). This procedure was repeated for several photon numbers \(N\). In each case, the initial state was chosen according to Eq. ( 7 ), which is not translation-invariant. As discussed in Sec.  II , there are two such inequivalent configurations and our results are averaged over both. We find that the bound states are robust for a finite range of \(\theta^{\prime}\)which decreases as the size of the bound states increases. 

We also address how the robustness changes as the bound states increase in size, but continue to be dilute relative to the total system size, \(N/L\ll 1\). We calculate the BSP for bound states between sizes \(N=3\)and \(N=12\), averaged over \(n_{c}=150\)cycles, to find \(\textnormal{BSP}(N,\theta^{\prime})\). The results for a fixed number of sites \(L=300+150\)are plotted in the inset of Fig.  7 (d), where it can be seen that the \(\textnormal{BSP}(N,\theta^{\prime})\)curves are starting to converge for larger values of \(N\). These results suggest that large but dilute bound states continue to be robust. 

The diagonal ensemble results, which directly access the infinite time limit \(t{\rightarrow}\infty\)of the BSP, can be seen in Fig.  7 (e). These results are consistent with the extrapolated TEBD results, suggesting small bound states are robust for a finite range of \(\theta^{\prime}\). In particular, the \(N{=}3\)bound states appear to be robust up to values of the integrability breaking that are comparable to the on
