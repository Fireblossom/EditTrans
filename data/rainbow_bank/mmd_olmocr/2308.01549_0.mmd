##### Abstract
Concatenation of a bosonic code with a qubit code is one of the promising ways to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation. As one of the most important bosonic codes, GottesmanKitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is proposed to correct small displacement error in phase space. If the noise in phase space is biased, square-lattice GKP code can be concatenated with XZZX surface code or repetition code that promises a high fault-tolerant threshold to suppress the logical error. In this work, we study the performance of GKP repetition codes with physical ancillary GKP qubits in correcting biased noise. We find that there exists a critical value of noise variance for the ancillary GKP qubit such that the logical Pauli error rate decreases when increasing the code size. Furthermore, one round of GKP error correction has to be performed before concatenating with repetition code. Our study paves the way for practical implementation of error correction by concatenating GKP code with low-level qubit codes. 

## INTRODUCTION 

Noise is the main hindrance to achieve large-scale faulttolerant quantum computation. Quantum error correcting code is introduced to correct errors by using redundancy in the Hilbert space [ 1 – 3 ]. Bosonic codes protect finitedimensional logical space by encoding it in an infinitedimensional bosonic quantum system [ 4 ,  5 ], e.g., a simple harmonic oscillator. Compared to the standard qubit codes that encode a single logical qubit using many physical qubits, the bosonic code is more hardware efficient and is subject to a smaller number of noisy channels [ 6 ,  7 ]. Currently well established bosonic codes include GottesmanKitaev-Preskill (GKP) code [ 8 ,  9 ], cat code [ 10 ,  11 ], binomial code [ 12 – 14 ], and rotation-symmetric code [ 15 ,  16 ]. The GKP code is one of the most promising bosonic codes, which corrects small displacement errors in phase space and also photon loss [ 6 ,  17 ]. Although the GKP code has been proposed for two decades [ 8 ], it is prepared only recently in ion-trapped [ 18 ,  19 ] and superconducting [ 20 ] platforms, and is used to extend the decoherence time of the logical qubit through error correction. The GKP code has promising advantages in optical quantum information processing [ 21 ], however optical GKP states have not been experimentally generated due to the stringent requirement for strong nonlinearity, though various preparation schemes have been proposed [ 22 – 26 ]. 

In order to achieve fault tolerance, the common strategy is to concatenate the GKP code with qubit codes to further suppress the logical error. Examples include concatenation with surface/toric codes [ 27 – 32 ], color code [ 33 – 35 ] etc. Concatenation with qubit codes with a high threshold enables a low squeezing threshold for the GKP states 

around 10 dB [ 27 ], which is within the reach of nearterm technologies. A variant of the original surface code, known as the XZZX surface code [ 36 ], has recently been shown to have a higher threshold for biased noise. It is expected that concatenation of GKP code with XZZX surface code would enable lower squeezing threshold if the displacement error is biased [ 37 ]. This can happen in two cases, either the noise is biased and a square-lattice (isotropic) GKP code is used, or the noise is isotropic and a biased GKP code is used. However, syndrome measurement and decoding are still complicated for the XZZX surface code [ 38 ], which therefore consume more physical and computational resources. A relatively easier scheme to suppress biased noise is to concatenate GKP code with repetition code [ 39 ], which requires easier syndrome measurement and decoding, and has a higher threshold. In Ref. [ 39 ], the error threshold has been estimated for biased GKP repetition code with isotropic noise, which outperforms the biased planar surface code [ 29 ]. However, both the data and ancillary GKP qubits are assumed to be ideal, namely, with infinitely energy. The error threshold as derived in Ref. [ 39 ] therefore only provides an upper bound, and the requirement is more stringent when the imperfections from the ancillary GKP qubits are taken into account. 

In this work, we study the concatenation of squarelattice GKP code with classical repetition code to correct biased displacement errors, where both the data and ancillary GKP qubits are physical. The error correction procedure consists of four steps: encoding, one round GKP error correction, syndrome measurement on repetition code and recovery operation according to the measurement outcomes. We find that the GKP error correction before concatenation in general increases the error rate of the GKP code and modifies the error profile, however, it is necessary in order to exploit the power of code concatenation. We also find that the logical Pauli
