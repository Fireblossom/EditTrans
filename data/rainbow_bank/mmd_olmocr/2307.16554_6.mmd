obvious like ill-health. If climate policy is successful, there is not much of a problem to solve anymore, making it harder to continue to justify spending large sums of money. In order to keep costs down, carbon capture will be done where land is cheap—that is, where few people live—and heavily mechanized. Paying 7% of your income in taxes to keep grandma alive and your nurse friend in work is one thing. Paying 7% to a multinational company to suck carbon dioxide out of the air in a faraway country is something else. 

### 3.3. Regional results 

The above results are for the world as a whole. The models in the IPCC database also report regional results. I restrict the attention to  imaclim  and one particular scenario which reduces emissions by 94% in 2050. The carbon tax is  $ 300/tCO 2  in 2030, rising to $ 1,298/tCO 2  in 2040 and  $ 2,253/tCO 2  in 2050. Figure  2  shows carbon tax revenue and sequestration subsidy, as a percentage of GDP, for 2030, 2040, and 2050. 

Global carbon tax revenue is 4% of GDP in 2050, a reasonable number, but 11% in 2030 and 19% in 2040—underlining yet again the fiscal challenge posed by stringent climate policy. 

The results in Figure  2  are ordered by per capita income in 2010. Carbon tax revenue is below the global average in the three richest regions, but above the global average in the seven poorest regions—with the exception of almost completely decarbonized India in 2050. The carbon tax revenue is very high in the carbon-intensive economies of the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. 

The bottom panel of Figure  2  shows the sequestration subsidies. The world total is 0.04% of GDP in 2030, rising to 3.8% in 2040 and 15% in 2050. As with tax revenues, the numbers are lower for the three rich regions and higher for the seven poor regions. Note, however, that it may well be that there will substantial transfers between regions. This is less likely with direct subsidies, more likely with tradable permits and offsets. 

That said, Figure  2  highlights the scale of the activity. The sequestration sector would occupy almost 15% of the world economy, over 35% of the economy in the former Soviet Union. 

### 3.4. Results for more lenient climate policy 

The above results are for very stringent climate policy. Cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 95% or more by 2050 is highly ambitious. The major fiscal implications highlighted above rapidly disappear for less stringent climate policy. This is because the fiscal implications are the product of carbon price and emissions. Take the subsidies for carbon dioxide removal first. A more lenient target would mean a lower volume at a lower price. The carbon tax revenue would fall too: Emissions would be higher but the carbon price lower; the former is linear, the latter exponential. 

Figure  3  illustrates this for the  imaclim  model for 2050. The top left panel plots the carbon price against emission reduction from baseline. The carbon price inches up until emissions are halved and then starts rising very quickly. However, emissions, shown in the bottom left
