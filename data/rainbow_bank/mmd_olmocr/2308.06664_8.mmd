where \(\rho^{T_{A}}\)is the partial transpose of \(\rho\)with with h resp ect to subsystem A, and \(\|X\|_{1}=Tr|X|=Tr\sqrt{X^{\dagger}X}\) is the trace norm or the sum of the singular value for the operator \(X\). Non-zero negativity values indicate the presence of quantum correlations in the form of entanglement, being greater the greater the amount of entanglement present. 

FIG. 7. Two-photon correlation function \(G^{(2)}_{N}(0)\)(a), (c), (e) and negativity \(\mathcal{N}(\rho)\)(b),(d),(f) as a function of the coupling strength \(\lambda\). In (a)-(d) both the two-photon correlation function and negativity are shown for several qubit number \(N\), including the thermodynamic limit, with the cold thermal reservoir temperature fixed at \(T_{c}=0.1\)(a)-(b) and \(T_{c}=2\)(c)-(d). In (e)-(f), the qubit number was fixed at \(N=8\)and the cold thermal reservoir temperature was chosen as \(T_{c}=0.1\)(blue solid line), \(T_{c}=0.4\)(red dash line), \(T_{c}=0.2\)(green dot line), and \(T_{c}=5\)(black dash line). The other system parameters are \(\omega_{c}=\omega\). The coupling strength \(\lambda\) and temperatures are in units of \(\omega\). 

We computed \(G^{(2)}(0)\)in Figs. (a),(c),(e) and \(\mathcal{N}(\rho)\)in Figs. 7(b),(d), (f) as a function of coupling strength for different number of qubits. In Figs. 7(e),(f) we set \(N=8\)and investigated the effect of different temperatures on the quantumness of the work substance. Note that the quantum correlations are degraded by increasing the number \(N\) of qubits and increasing the temperature \(T_{h}\), whereas \(\eta\) and \(\xi\) increase with the number of qubits for all temperatures. If we compare the Figs. 7(a)-(f) showing maximum antibunching and maximum entanglement with Figs 4(a)-(f) and 5(a)-(b), which respectively show efficiency and COP, we will see that there is no correspondence between the maximum of quantum correlations and the maximum of efficiency and COP. As far as the second-order correlation is concerned, the efficiency is higher in the deep strong coupling regime ( \(\lambda>2\)), Figs.  4(b),(e), and therefore, far from the region where the second-order correlation shows the subPoissonian effect. The same conclusion can be drawn from Fig.5(a)-(c) for the COP, whose maxima lie in regions far from the value of the critical parameter \(\lambda\). With regard to negativity, Figs.7(b), (d), and (f) show that the maximum of negativity, and therefore of entanglement, does not coincide with the maximum of efficiency and COP. For example, in Fig. 4(b) for \(T_{c}=0.1\)and various values of \(N\), the efficiency is practically constant with the coupling parameter, and therefore independent of the amount of entanglement, whereas in Fig.7(b) the negativity, also at \(T_{c}=0.1\)and the various values of \(N\) presents maximums and minimums when varying the coupling parameter. The same can be said about the COP: there is nothing in the analysis of the maximums that indicates the relevance of negativity for its improvement. Take for example Fig.7(d) for \(T_{c}=2\), where negativity remains zero for a large range of values of \(\lambda\) and then increases monotonically until to \(\lambda=2\), with similar behavior even for different values of \(N\). Compare with Fig.5(c), where the COP has a very different behavior depending on \(N\), with no correspondence with negativity. These same conclusions are supported by additional numerical calculations that we performed (not shown here). To summarize this Section, and as previously mentioned, we point out that the improvement in the efficiency and performance of the UQOHM using the Dicke model as the working substance cannot be attributed to quantum resources [99, 100], but it is due to the high anharmonicity of the spectrum around the critical point of the Dicke model. 

## CONCLUSION 

In summary, in this work we propose a universal quantum Otto heat machine (UQOHM) based on the open Dicke model (ODM). The ODM is composed of N atoms of two levels (qubits) that interact with a mode of the electromagnetic field and both the mode and the N qubits, which constitute the working substance of the universal machine, interact with thermal reservoirs. This model presents a critical point and can be solved analytically in the thermodynamic limit \(N\rightarrow\infty\). By universal thermal machine we mean that it is possible, by adjusting the atom-field coupling parameter \(\lambda\) of the ODM, to build all types of thermal machines, namely engines, refrigerators, heaters, and accelerators. Focusing on engines and refrigerators, which are the machines with the greatest applicability, we show, for a wide temperature range and
