### Discussion of Model Assumptions 

**Payoffs** Two characteristics of the payoff function must be noted. First, the utility is additively separable in each players’ output, ruling out static strategic complementarities between players’ actions, a modelling choice that allows us to isolate disagreement as a driving force of our results. 27 27 For the same reason, the output stochastic process rules out _ technological_  complementarities between players’ efforts. Such complementarities would have relevant and well-known implications for the productivity Second, we allow players utility to depend on each other’s output. of heterogeneous vs homogeneous groups (e.g., Prat, 2002), but are not the focus of the present study. We interpret this as a reduced-form way of capturing how the overall team performance in a project can feedback positively on each team member. In particular, the positive externalities imply that players benefit from increasing each others’ production and breakthroughs. In section 6, we discuss how our results are impacted under different assumptions regarding the sign of production externalities. 

**Action Informativeness** In both example 1 and example 2, the technology views have the property that higher effort is more informative than lower effort, as we show in the appendix. Intuitively, in the bandit problem higher effort increases \(F(e)\)the probability of a return, making players subjectively more likely to parse between \(\mathcal{H}\) and \(\mathcal{L}\) at the end of the period. In the log-concave noise example, an increase in effort makes the two alternative views’ predictions diverge – so that high output realization becomes stronger evidence in favor of \(\mathcal{H}\) while low output realizations become stronger evidence in favor of \(\mathcal{L}\). While 3 is in practice satisfied by many applications (e.g., Keller et al., 2005; Heidhues et al., 2018; Dong, 2018; Ba, 2022), in section 6 we briefly discuss the implications of other relations between the productivity and informativeness of actions, providing an example of a technology that violates assumption 3. 

**Different Models and Model Shifts** Three non-standard assumptions about model and model shifts are worth discussing. First, in our model players can agree to disagree on the true model of the world. When they hold different models, Ann sees Bob’s model as misspecified – for instance because based on the wrong hypotheses. Hence, she does not regard it as informative of the true process \(Q\). Second, for \(\alpha\) low, the model switch rule LR means that
