##### Abstract
PM-Gati-Shakti Initiative, integration of ministries, including railways, ports, waterways, logistic infrastructure, mass transport, airports, and roads. Aimed at enhancing connectivity and bolstering the competitiveness of Indian businesses, the initiative focuses on six pivotal pillars known as "Connectivity for Productivity": comprehensiveness, prioritization, optimization, synchronization, analytical, and dynamic. In this study, we explore the application of these pillars to address the problem of "Maximum Demand Forecasting in Delhi." Through a detailed case study, we seek to comprehend and formalize the use cases associated with this crucial forecasting task, illuminating the potential and impact of the PM-Gati Shakti scheme in shaping India’s energy landscape and driving sustainable growth. Electricity forecasting plays a very significant role in the power grid as it is required to maintain a balance between supply and load demand at all times, to provide a quality electricity supply, for Financial planning, generation reserve, and many more. Forecasting helps not only in Production Planning but also in Scheduling like Import / Export which is very often in India and mostly required by the rural areas and North Eastern Regions of India. As Electrical Forecasting includes many factors which cannot be detected by the models out there, We use Classical Forecasting Techniques to extract the seasonal patterns from the daily data of Maximum Demand for the Union Territory Delhi. This research contributes to the power supply industry by helping to reduce the occurrence of disasters such as blackouts, power cuts, and increased tariffs imposed by regulatory commissions. The forecasting techniques can also help in reducing OD and UD of Power for different regions. We use the Data provided by a department from the Ministry of Power and use different forecast models including Seasonal forecasts for daily data.

## Introduction 

The Indian Energy GRID is maintained by POWERGRID [ 0 ] which has the objectives of running the GRID efficiently and installing transmission lines etc... and the second one is the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) [ 0 ] which concentrates on Supervision over the Regional Load Dispatch Centres, Scheduling and dispatch of electricity over inter-regional links in accordance with grid standards specified by the Authority and grid code specified by Central Commission in coordination with Regional Load Dispatch Centres, Monitoring of operations and grid security of the National Grid, etc... This research mainly focusses on this NLDC which is a Division of Ministry of Power. 

Fig 1 [ 0 ] describes the Yearly Installed Power Capacity in Delhi. The highest installed Capacity was 8,346.72 MW in Fiscal year 2016. which is responsible for sending the energy from Stations to sub-stations and to discuss and then to homes, industries, commercials, etc... As of 21-06-2023 The installed Capacity Sector-wise data [ 0 ] gives an overview of what type of Thermal Plants which are present in Delhi and also what types of Energy resources are present in Delhi.
