# Fault Tolerance in Euclidean Committee Selection 

\(i\leqslant j\). By assumption, before the modification we have \(|T^{*}\cap C_{i,j}|\geqslant\delta_{i,j}(f)\). If \(j\geqslant k_{t}\), then \(|T^{*}\cap C_{i,j}|\) does not decrease after the modification, and is thus at least \(\delta_{i,j}(f)\). So assume \(j<k_{t}\). In this case, \(T\cap C_{i,j}=\{c_{k_{1}},\dots,c_{k_{t-1}}\}\cap C_{i,j}\subseteq T^{*}\cap C _{i,j}\). Since \(|T\cap C_{i,j}|\geqslant\delta_{i,j}(f)\)by Lemma 3, we have \(|T^{*}\cap C_{i,j}|\geqslant\delta_{i,j}(f)\). 

We use binary search to find the smallest \(r\) such that the reduced instance has an \(f\)-tolerant hitting set of size at most \(k\). Therefore, the following theorem holds. 

▶ _ Optimal Fault-Tolerant Committee can be solved in time_ \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2}m^{3}f\log(nm))\)_for one-dimensional Euclidean elections._ 

▶ Remark 10.  Our dynamic programming algorithm works as long as either the set \(V\) or the set \(C\) is embedded in \(\mathbb{R}\) (i.e., has a linear ordering), while the other set can have an arbitrary \(d\)-dimensional embedding. Moreover, we can also extend our algorithms to ordinal elections with (widely studied) single-peaked preferences [ 2  26 ] to compute an optimal fault-tolerant Chamberlin-Courant committee. 

## Fault-Tolerant Committees in Multidimensional Space 

We now consider fault tolerance in multidimensional elections. Unsurprisingly, the optimal committee design problem is intractable — it is similar to facility location — but it turns out that the seemingly simpler variants ORP and FTS are also intractable. 

### Hardness Results 

▶ **Theorem 11**  ( _⋆_ ) **.** _ All three problems (Optimal Replacement, Fault-Tolerance Score, and_ _Optimal Fault-Tolerant Committee) are NP-hard, in any dimension_ \(d\geqslant 2\)_ under the Euclidean_ _norm, where size of the committee_ \(k\)_ and the failure parameter_ \(f\)_ are part of the input._ 

We will use a single construction to show NP-hardness all three problems. Our proof uses a reduction from the NP-complete problem  Planar Monotone 3-SAT  (PM-3SAT) 7 ]. An input to this problem is a _ monotone_  3-CNF formula \(\varphi\) where each clause contains either three positive literals or three negative literals, and whose variable-clause incidence graph has a planar embedding which is given as a part of the input. Given an instance \(\varphi\) of PM-3SAT, our reduction constructs a 2-dimensional Euclidean election. The general outline follows a scheme used in [ 32 ] to show the hardness of committee selection under _ ordinal_ preferences, but generalizing the proof to _ fault-tolerant committees_  requires several technical modifications and a new proof of correctness. 

For ease of referencing, we adapt the terminologies from [ 32 ]. In the planar embedding of the formula \(\varphi\), each variable/clause is drawn as an (axis-parallel) rectangle in the plane, and so this is called a _ rectangular embedding_ . See Figure 2a for an illustration. The rectangles for the variables are drawn along the \(x\)-axis, while the rectangles for the positive (resp., negative) clauses lie above (resp., below) the \(x\)-axis. If a clause contains a variable, then there is a vertical segment connecting the clause rectangle and the variable rectangle. Each such vertical segment is disjoint from all the rectangles except the two it connects. 

The rectangular embedding of \(\varphi\) can be modified to another embedding which is easier to work with called _ orthogonal embedding_ . We refer the reader to [ 33 ] for details of the modification (See figure 2b for intuition). The intersection points of vertical and horizontal segments in the orthogonal embedding are _ connection points_ . To build the intuition for the orthogonal embedding, we now give its properties as stated in [33]:
