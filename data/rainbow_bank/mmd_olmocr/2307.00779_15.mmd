in which \(s_{1}=(y_{1},x_{1})\)and \(s_{2}=(y_{2},x_{2})\). The dual problem \(\mathcal{J}(\delta)\)corresponding to the primal problem \(\mathcal{I}(\delta)\)is defined as follows: 

\[\mathcal{J}(\delta)=\begin{cases}\inf_{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{ 2}}\left\{\langle\lambda,\delta\rangle+\sup_{\varpi\in\Pi(\mu_{13},\mu_{23})} \int_{\mathcal{V}}f_{\lambda}d\varpi\right\}&\text{ if }\delta\in\mathbb{R}^{2 }_{++},\\ \inf_{\lambda_{1}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}}\left\{\lambda_{1}\delta_{1}+\sup_{\varpi \in\Pi(\mu_{13},\mu_{23})}\int_{\mathcal{V}}f_{\lambda_{1},1}d\varpi\right\}& \text{ if }\delta_{1}>0\text{ and }\delta_{2}=0,\\ \inf_{\lambda_{2}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}}\left\{\lambda_{2}\delta_{2}+\sup_{\varpi \in\Pi(\mu_{13},\mu_{23})}\int_{\mathcal{V}}f_{\lambda_{2},2}d\varpi\right\}& \text{ if }\delta_{1}=0\text{ and }\delta_{2}>0.\end{cases}\  

Theorem Suppose that _ hold. Then,_ \(\mathcal{I}(\delta)=\mathcal{J}(\delta)\)_for all_ \(\delta\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}\setminus\{0\}\)_._ 

An interesting feature of the dual for overlapping marginals is that it involves marginal problems with non-overlapping marginals, i.e., \(\sup_{\varpi\in\Pi(\mu_{13},\mu_{23})}\int_{\mathcal{V}}f_{\lambda}(v)d\varpi(v)\), although the uncertainty set in the primal problem involves overlapping marginals. Compared with the non-overlapping marginals case, overlapping marginals in the uncertainty set make the relevant consistent product marginal system in the verification of the existence of a joint measure more complicated, see the proof of Lemma  C.5 . Nonetheless, the non-overlapping marginals in the dual allow us to apply Theorem  A.1  to the marginal problem involving \(f_{\lambda}\), \(f_{\lambda,1}\) and \(f_{\lambda,2}\), see corollary  A.2  in Appendix  A.2 . 

Under the assumptions in Theorem  5.2 , we have 

\[\mathcal{I}(\delta)=\inf_{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}}\left[ \langle\lambda,\delta\rangle+\sup_{\varpi\in\Pi(\mu_{13},\mu_{23})}\int_{ \mathcal{V}}f_{\lambda}\,d\varpi\right]\]  

for all \(\delta\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}\). 

**Remark 3.3.** _ Similar to the non-overlapping case, we can define an alternative_ _W-DMR with overlapping marginals through linear penalty terms, i.e.,_ 

\[\sup_{\gamma\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S})}\left\{\int_{\mathcal{S}} g\,d\gamma-\lambda_{1}\boldsymbol{K}_{1}(\mu_{13},\gamma_{13})-\lambda_{2} \boldsymbol{K}_{2}(\mu_{23},\gamma_{23}):\boldsymbol{K}_{\ell}(\mu_{\ell 3}, \gamma_{\ell 3})<\infty\text{ for }\ell=1,2\right\},\]  

_with_ \(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}\in\mathbb{R}_{++}\)_. The proof of Theorem_ _ 3.2_ _ implies that the dual form of this_ _problem is_ \(\sup_{\varpi\in\Pi(\mu_{13},\mu_{23})}\int_{\mathcal{V}}f_{\lambda}\,d\varpi\)_ under the conditions in Theorem_ _ 3.2_ _._

Let \(\mathcal{S}_{1}=\mathbb{R}\), \(\mathcal{S}_{2}=\mathbb{R}\), \(\mu_{1}\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}_{1})\), and \(\mu_{2}\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}_{2})\). Further, let \(Z=S_{1}+S_{2}\), where \(S_{1},S_{2}\) are random variables whose probability measures are \(\mu_{1},\mu_{2}\) respectively. For a given \(z\in\mathbb{R}\), let \(F_{Z}(z)=\mathbb{E}_{o}[g(S_{1},S_{2})]\), where \(g(s_{1},s_{2})=\mathds{1}\left\{s_{1}+s_{2}\leq z\right\}\).
