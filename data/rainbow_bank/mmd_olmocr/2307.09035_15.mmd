and those with a one standard deviation increase in advertising expenditures, holding all other variables at their mean levels. We also compute these results for different levels of lockdowns and for each period. 

We find that an average increase in government lockdowns is associated with a 7.8 percentage point increase in the probability of closure across our full sample. Figure 1 shows the estimated differences in the probability of closure for different baseline levels of government lockdowns. We find that the impact of these lockdowns was strongest at lower baseline levels and diminishes as these levels increase. This suggests that businesses had the most difficulty surviving the initial shock of the lockdowns, while subsequent increases in the severity of these lockdowns had less of an impact. Figure 2 shows the estimated difference in the probability of closure for each period of our study. We find that the impact of lockdowns was greater in March and May or later, with a slight decrease in April. This result broadly corresponds to our findings in Figure 1, in which lockdowns were at or close to zero in most countries before the pandemic was declared in mid-March, increased substantially in April, and decreased in May before leveling off afterward. 

We also find that a one standard deviation increase in advertising is associated with a 2.8 percentage point decrease on average in the probability of closure across our full sample. Figure 3 shows the estimated differences in the probability of closure for different levels of lockdowns. We find small changes in this estimate across different level of lockdowns. Although the estimated differences in the probability of closure increase slightly as lockdowns become more severe, they stay close to its mean of 2.8. Figure 4 shows the estimated difference in the probability of closure for each period of our study. Again, we find small differences in this estimate across periods, though still larger in March and May or later, which corresponds to the pattern observed in Figure 2. Overall, we find evidence that both government lockdowns and advertising expenditures had an impact on business closures during the pandemic. The results thus far, however, are based on our full sample. In the following subsections, we investigate potential heterogeneous responses that may exist between key subpopulations, including analyses by country, industry, and business size. 

### Results by Country and Region 

We use the results in the third column of Table 2 to calculate the estimated effect of government lockdowns across countries. Similar to our previous analysis, we compute the difference in prob
