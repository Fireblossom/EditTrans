### Study 1 

Based on the pilot, we decided to proceed by fixing the reported bugs and replacing the usability scale with potential mediators to better assess which users would prefer the different bots. We conducted this study with n=71 participants (see Section 3). 

#### Measures 

In Study 1, we added 7-level bipolar rating scales for direct comparison (See Section 3.2). We were interested in how much control participants experienced; how natural they felt the chats to be; how well their intent was fulfilled in the chats; and how satisfied they were with them. See Table 2 for items and reliabilities of the constructs. 

To account for potential mediation, we assessed interindividual difference variables, namely the most prominent personality measure, big 5, using a 15-item scale (BFI-2-XS) [ 39 ]. As insert expansions exist to smooth interaction by shaping expectations, we also assessed our participants need for cognitive closure (NFC-15) [40].

#### Procedure 

After a short demographic questionnaire, n=71 participants were given 3 scenarios (see Figure 2), rating each before turning to the next (see Figure 3.2). Having completed all scenarios and evaluations, feedback was elicited and interindividual variables were assessed. 

#### Feedback 

To quantify the feedback, we repeated the procedure described for the pilot. Feedback on the study was 69.01% positive (neutral opinions tend to be rated as negative as well, e.g. "I have no opinion about the study."), on the interface only 52.11% (negatives include no feedback at all, neutral statements such as "It was fast and responsive, just feel like the loading is too big and the lettering also", but also some on bugs like "It was fine, although sometimes my prompt would trigger a loading animation that the bot would never reply to, so I had to prompt again, which left the loading anim on the screen for one of the bots but not the other, not a big deal." or "It was frusting when it could not listen or answer all
