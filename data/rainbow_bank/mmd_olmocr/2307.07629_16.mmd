ongoing efforts are being made to enhance this practice. A notable example of these initiatives is led by Doctors Without Borders, also known as MÂ´edecins Sans Fronti`eres (Barel et al., 2020). 

### Results-based payments without screening 

In this subsection, the principal is restricted to using payments that can only depend on the realized posterior. Following the terminology in Yoder (2022), we define a _ results-_ _based contract_  as a contingent payment function \(t:\Delta\left(\Omega\right)\to\mathbb{R}\). We say that \((\mathcal{X},t)\)is incentive-compatible if 

\[\mathbb{E}_{p\sim\mathcal{X}(\theta)}[t(p)]-\theta\mathcal{C}( \mathcal{X}(\theta))\geq\mathbb{E}_{p\sim\tau}[t(p)]-\theta\mathcal{C}(\tau) \quad\forall\theta{\equalswidth\makebox[0.0pt][c]{$\oldin$}}\Theta,\forall\tau {\equalswidth\makebox[0.0pt][c]{$\oldin$}}X.\] (6)  

Because the principal cannot price discriminate according to different reports, a results-based contract must provide incentives for all researcher types. 

We aim to investigate whether \((\mathcal{X}^{*},T^{*})\)can be implemented using a results-based contract. In the case of two states, Yoder (2022) demonstrates that the optimal choice function \(\mathcal{X}^{*}\)must be Blackwell-monotone. In such a case, a binary, Blackwell-monotone choice function is implementable by a results-based contract that induces the payment rule \(T^{*}\). However, as shown in Example 1, this may not be the case when there are more than two states, as the optimal choice function need not be Blackwell-monotone. Thus, it is important to understand how Blackwell monotonicity relates to implementability in a broader context. 

We will introduce an additional assumption on \(\mathcal{X}^{*}\)going forward to simplify the analysis. This assumption requires that every experiment has the same number of posteriors as \(|\Omega|\). While this assumption is restrictive, it allows for a clear characterization of implementable experiment choice functions. 3 3 It rules out cases where the number of posteriors in the support of the desired experiment is strictly less than the number of states. Without this assumption, comprehending the outcome-equivalence result
