\[\begin{split}W=-\frac{1}{4}E_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}&\biggl{\{}(1- \alpha)\left(x_{Nt}^{2}+\frac{\theta_{N}}{\kappa_{N}}\pi^{2}_{Nt}\right)+ \tilde{\alpha}\left(x_{Tt}^{2}+\frac{\theta_{T}}{\kappa_{T}}\pi^{2}_{Ht}\right )\\ &+\left(1-\alpha^{\ast}\right)\left(x_{Nt}^{\ast 2}+\frac{\theta^{\ast}}{ \kappa_{N}^{\ast}}\pi_{Nt}^{\ast 2}\right)+\tilde{\alpha}^{\ast}\left(x_{Tt}^{ \ast 2}+\frac{\theta^{\ast}}{\kappa_{T}^{\ast}}\pi_{Ft}^{\ast 2}\right)\biggr{ \}}\end{split}\] (11)  

where asterisks denote foreign variables and with \(\theta_{j},\,j=\{N,T\}\), representing the elasticity of substitution between the differentiated goods in sector \(j\). 7 7 The weighting placed on each sector is proportional Liu and Pappa  ( 2008 to the sectorâ€™s size. This is \((1-\alpha)\)) also consider policy under a Nash regime. For the purposes of this paper, for the non-tradable sector while that for tradables is adjusted to comparing commitment to discretion, it makes no difference what regime is implemented. take into account that the planner internalises the terms of trade externality so that. Moreover, the more that prices are flexible in a given sector the lower the weight that the planner places on stabilising inflation in that sector. 

In parameterising the model, we follow the values used by  Liu and Pappa  ( 2008 ), which are shown in Table  2

We again solve the model under discretion, commitment and the stabilisation of an inflation index, \(\pi^{T}_{t}\). For this model, the latter is given by 

\[\pi^{T}_{t}=\varphi\pi_{Nt}+(1-\varphi)\pi_{Ht}\] (12)  

and an analogous index is used for the foreign economy. The losses as we alter the size of the tradable sector in either country are shown in Figure  5  where for comparability with  Liu and Pappa  ( 2008 ), the losses are reported as a proportion of steady state consumption. The first thing to note is that losses under discretion are not reported as they are almost identical to those under commitment and the reason is explained by the right panel. It shows that when the policy maker stabilises an inflation index in each country described by ( 12 ), the resulting outcomes are identical to those under commitment, so that the stabilisation bias is zero. Further detail is provided by Figure  6 , which shows how the optimal value of \(\varphi\) changes with the values of \(\alpha\) and \(\alpha^{\ast}\). 8 As the size of the tradable sector ( 8 \(\alpha\)As the figure for ) increases, the optimal \(\varphi^{\ast}\)value of \(\varphi\)is analogous, it is not reported.  falls monotonically, albeit non-linearly. These responses are consistent with those obtained from implementing ( 6 ) in the model by  Woodford  ( 2003 ) considered earlier and by  Benigno  ( 2004 ). 

We can additionally conduct the analysis in Section  2.2  of altering the degree of relative degrees of price rigidities whilst maintaining the overall aggregate measure intact. To do this, we can re-write the welfare objective ( 11 ) as
