FIG. 2. ** Light transport in the lattice and average NPR under varying random-dimer on-site potential. (a)**  The four simulated trajectories of light in \(1000~{}\mu\)m long SSH lattices comprising \(100\) sites with varying degrees of random dimer disorder are displayed. ** I** , ** II** , ** III** , and ** IV** correspond to random-dimer on-site potentials, \(\varepsilon=0\), \(0.1\), \(0.185\), and \(0.3\) respectively, with random-dimer assignment probability of \(p=0.5\). In ** I** , a ballistic light propagation takes place without any disorder present; in ** II**  and ** IV** , light becomes localized within the lattice at the designed random-dimer on-site potentials, despite significant propagation distance. ** III**  demonstrates the phenomenon of reentrant localization, where both extended and localized states coexist. ** (b)**  The numerically computed mean NPR as a function of random-dimer potential \(\epsilon\) over a range of lattice sites from \(30\) to \(1000\). As the number of lattice sites increases, the mean NPR exhibits a declining trend, yet the counterintuitive reentrant peaks consistently emerge. The four light transport simulations coincide with the different regimes in the mean NPR plot, as denoted by the color coding and labeling ** I**  to ** IV** . . 

the random-dimer onsite potential, followed by the analysis of the non-zero region for both these parameters. An alternative strategy involves computing a defined parameter \(\eta\) as \(\eta=\log_{10}[\langle\mathrm{IPR}\rangle\times\langle\mathrm{NPR}\rangle]\). By assessing the ratio of extended to localized states within all N eigenstates, we establish the criteria for the reentrant regime. The detailed derivation can be found in the ** Supplementary information** : 

\[\mathrm{log_{10}}\left(\frac{2}{N}\right)\leq\eta\leq\mathrm{log_{10}}\left( \frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2N}\right)\] (5)  

In our experiment, we select a lattice with \(N=100\) sites, as depicted in Fig.  1 (a), and generate a random-dimer number array with a probability \(p=0.5\) according to Eq. ( 2 ). We choose \(t=0.08\) and \(\Delta=0.25\), so the intra/inter-cell coupling strength is \(0.1\) and \(0.06\), which sets the lattice at the topologically trivial phase [ 29 ]. Fig.  1 (b) presents the results of sweeping the on-site potential from \(0\) to \(0.4\) across the random-dimer number array. Subsequently, we conduct numerical calculations to determine the lattice’s spectrum, unveiling the system’s energy levels and their corresponding IPR. The spectrum of the system is given by four well distinguished bands, centered around \(E_{\nu,\pm}=\nu\epsilon\pm t(1+\Delta)\), with wave functions, living mostly on the dimers with the on-site potential \(\epsilon_{n}=\nu\epsilon\), \(\nu=0,1\), and being symmetric (antisymmetric) at each of such dimers with the corresponding energy shift \(\mp t(1+\Delta)\), respectively, see ** Supplemental** 

**Information** . The width of each band is given by the smaller hopping \(2t(1-\Delta)\). The blue curve uncovers the closing and reopening of the energy gap in the system, signifying the topological phase transition of the eigenstates. It is this gap closure which is responsible for the reentrant delocalization. Indeed, close to the intersection of \(2\) bands, the effective disorder is given by the difference of energy centers \(E_{\nu,\pm}\). As soon as \(2\) bands cross, this difference goes to zero and a disorder-free sector of the Hamiltonian with delocalized states emerges at this crossing-band pair. The states in the other pair of bands stay localized. This explains the reentrant character of delocalization-localization phase diagram. 

Fig.  2 (a) displays the simulated pattern of the \(41\)st single-site excitation obtained using the coupled mode theory [ 41 – 43 ] to showcase the evolution of light within lattices having a length of \(1000~{}\mu\)m. The on-site potentials \(\epsilon\) of these lattices are \(0\), \(0.1\), \(0.185\) and \(0.3\), from left to right. Comparing Fig.  2 (a) ** III**  with ** II**  and ** I** , we observe that the light undergoes a distinct behavior in ** III** . In this intermediate regime ** III** , a part of the light intensity stays near the initial location as in ** II** , but another part ballistically spreads as in ** I1** . This gives evidence of a coexistence of localized and extended light, observed simultaneously. Unexpectedly this coexistence appears even after the light has transitioned into the fully localized regime ** II**  upon reaching the critical value of the on-site potential, \(\epsilon\). Furthermore, as we continuously increase \(\epsilon\), the light evolution pattern in regime ** IV**  reverts back to exhibiting localized behavior,
