To explore the sensitivity of IRFs to states, Figure  7  draws the IRFs calculated for different realized values of \((X_{t-1},R_{t-1})\). We use \((X_{t-1}^{p},R_{t-1}^{p})\) to denote the percentile points of the realized \((X_{t-1},R_{t-1})\)states on the stationary distribution. The top left panel shows that price responses are stronger when availability becomes larger. The immediate responses of price are respectively 1.72 and 2.17 times larger when availability increases from the \(25\%\)percentile to the \(75\%\)and \(95\%\)percentiles. This is because when availability is lower, inventory tends to be lower and there is less room for stock adjustment, hence prices react much less in response to the interest rate shock. This intuition is partially verified by the top middle panel, which shows that a higher availability causes stock decumulation to last longer, yielding a larger decline in inventory in the medium to long run (in spite of a slightly lower immediate decline).
