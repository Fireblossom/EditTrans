III.C.2. ** Application of a Unitary Transformation:**  In this part of the circuit, a series of Let \(G_{i}\in\left\{I,X,Y,Z,H,S,T,R_{X},R_{Y},R_{Z},\text{CNOT},\text{SWAP},\ldots\right\}\) be Quantum gates, for \(1\leqslant i\leqslant m\), and then we apply a series of Quantum gates on the initial state. We can a unitary operator, i.e. \(U=\bigotimes_{i=1}^{m}G_{i}\). Mathematically, this part of the circuit is given by \(U\ket{\Psi_{0}(\boldsymbol{\theta})}\equiv\ket{\Psi(\boldsymbol{\theta})}\). III.C.3. ** Measurement:**  Measurement is performed on the result \(U(\boldsymbol{\theta})\) in order to extract 

Steps III.C.2. and III.C.3. are repeated in order to minimise the loss function, \(J(\boldsymbol{\theta})\), and
