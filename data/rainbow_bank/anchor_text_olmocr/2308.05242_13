[72x252]3.9 Comparative Analysis of Smaller Dataset (65 Images) and Larger Dataset (2700 Images) using Principal
[94x241]Component Analysis
[72x219]We conducted an experiment using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for image reconstruction with both smaller
[72x208](65 images) and larger (2700 images) datasets, utilizing 50 principal components for representation. The explained
[72x197]variance for the smaller dataset was approximately
[72x197]98
[282x197].
[285x197]19%
[303x197], while for the larger one it was roughly
[303x197]98
[469x197].
[472x197]35%
[472x197](Figure 18).
[72x181]However, visual inspections revealed a marked degradation in quality between the two datasets(Figure 18). In the 65-
[72x170]image dataset, the reconstructions showed anomalies like purplish lines in the background and bluish color distortions.
[72x159]For the 2700-image dataset, the performance was even worse, with greenish horizontal lines appearing in the foreground
[72x148]and failure in capturing essential details. Several factors may contribute to this unexpected result. The increased
[72x137]complexity and variability within the larger dataset might have overwhelmed PCA's ability to represent finer details.
[72x127]Since PCA relies on linear assumptions, it might have failed to handle the nonlinear structures and dependencies that
[72x116]become more pronounced with the increase in data complexity. The

[381x116]unexplained variance might contain
[72x105]critical information affecting the visual quality, especially in a larger, more intricate dataset. Moreover, the choice of 50
[72x94]components might have been insufficient for capturing nuanced variations in the larger dataset, despite sufficing for the
[72x83]smaller one. These observations highlight PCA's limitations in handling highly complex image data and emphasize that
[72x72]capturing a high percentage of variance does not guarantee accurate or visually pleasing reconstruction.
