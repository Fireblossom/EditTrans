[79x690]of this transformative change. While previous studies have primarily focused on examining
[79x674]historical events from a more distant past, there has been relatively limited investigation
[79x659]into recent changes in history and their effects on gender roles. By providing insights
[79x643]into the influence of constitutional inclusion and the promotion of gender equality through
[79x627]education, our research enhances our understanding of the dynamics surrounding gender
[79x611]norms. It emphasizes the crucial role of constitutional frameworks in shaping outcomes
[79x595]related to gender equality and sheds light on the impact of societal attitudes and women's
[79x579]labor force participation.
[97x557]The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the
[79x541]process of creating and drafting the 1991 constitution, focusing on the inclusion of women's
[79x525]rights. Section 3 outlines the data utilized in our study and presents our empirical strategy.
[79x510]Section 4 presents our main findings. Section 5 offers additional evidence supporting our
[79x494]primary identification assumption and provides a range of robustness checks. Section 6
[79x478]concludes.
[79x436]2 Background
[97x408]Colombia, throughout the majority of the 20th century, adhered to traditional and
[79x392]conservative gender norms deeply embedded in the long-standing political constitution
[79x376]dating back to 1886. Despite a notable constitutional reform in 1936 and various legislative
[79x360]measures aimed at protecting women's economic and social rights, the formal recognition
[79x344]of women's rights as a constitutional requirement was only accomplished with the drafting
[79x329]of a new political constitution in 1991 (Iregui-BohÂ´ orquez
[373x329]et al.
[399x329], 2020).
[97x307]The National Constituent Assembly (NCA) of 1991 played a pivotal role in this process.
[79x291]Convened specifically to draft the current political constitution, known as the Constitution
[79x275]of 1991, it marked a significant turning point in Colombia's 20th-century history. The NCA
[79x259]aimed to establish an institutional framework to address the persistent cycles of violence
[79x243]and armed conflicts. The approval of the new Constitution formalized a social pact and
[79x227]provided the foundation for the development of a social state of law, promoting the peaceful
[79x211]resolution of social and political conflicts. This transformative process brought together
[79x195]various initiatives and fostered the expansion of representative democracy.
[97x174]Under the new constitution, significant progress was made in recognizing and protect-
[79x158]ing the rights of marginalized groups, including the recognition of women's rights that
[79x142]were absent from the original 1886 constitution. Subsequent reforms addressed this gap
[79x126]by granting women the right to vote, access higher education, exercise independent control
[79x110]over their assets in marriage, and abolishing marital authority, among other changes. These
[79x94]advancements primarily took place within the legislative domain rather than the consti-
[79x78]tutional realm. However, it is important to note that despite these legal improvements,
