[58x702]decline in activity on Stack Overflow.
[87x677]We report the estimated effect of our difference-in-differences model in Table 1 and visualize the
[58x661]weekly estimates of the relative change in the Stack Overflow activity in Figure 2. Table 1 indicates that
[58x644]ChatGPT decreased posting activity on Stack Overflow by 15.6% (

[426x644]). These results are robust
[58x628]to changes in the controls and starting point of the data time series. We also tested for heterogeneity in
[58x611]subsets of the data: considering only questions (rather than counting both questions and answers) and
[58x595]posts on weekdays. In both subsets our estimates did not deviate significantly from the main result: we
[58x579]estimate a 12% relative decrease in questions and 14% relative decrease in posts on weekdays.

[58x383]Table 1: Results of a difference-in-differences model, estimating the change in activity observed weekly on Stack Overflow
[58x372]following the release of ChatGPT, relative to activity on four other platforms less likely to have been impacted. All
[58x361]regressions comprise platform fixed effects, week fixed effects, and platform-specific linear time-trends. The standard-error
[58x350]of the estimate clustered on month is reported in parentheses. Significance codes: ***:

[87x310]Figure 2 shows that the impact of ChatGPT is increasing over time and is by the end of our study
[58x293]greater in magnitude than the average post-ChatGPT effect estimated in Table 1. By the end of April
[58x277]2023, the estimated effect stabilizes at around 25%. Interestingly, ChatGPT use, in general, peaked
[58x260]around this time.
