[72x716]encoded as qubits. Therefore, the quantum source node can transmit information to the quantum
[72x695]destination node using entangled pairs. When the source node and the destination node are distant
[72x674]from each other, remote entanglement connections are established according to the assigned rout-
[72x653]ing. Intermediate quantum nodes, known as quantum repeaters, connect source and destination
[72x633]nodes using entanglement swapping, which involves joint Bell state measurements, to create a
[72x612]remote entanglement connection \[6\]. Therefore, a critical challenge for constructing quantum
[72x591]networks at a large scale is the efficient utilization of entangled pairs and the identification of
[72x570]optimal routing strategies for managing massive entanglement connections.
[84x549]Meanwhile, maintaining Entanglement fidelity is crucial to ensure high-quality remote en-
[72x529]tanglement connections, as the noise in the system \[8\] may prevent quantum repeaters from
[72x508]producing entangled pairs with the desired fidelity. Low-fidelity entangled pairs can adversely
[72x487]impact the quality of services offered by quantum applications \[10\]. For example, when the
[72x466]fidelity of entangled pairs falls below the quantum bit error rate (BER) in quantum cryptographic
[72x445]protocols, it can lead to the degradation of the security of key distribution \[11\]. Fortunately, the
[72x425]entanglement purification techniques \[12\]â€“\[14\] can improve the fidelity of entangled pairs by
[72x404]using additional entangled pairs. These techniques utilize multiple entangled pairs to combine
[72x383]them in various ways to increase the fidelity of the final purified entangled pair, such as
[72x362]entanglement distillation, quantum error correction, and decoherence-free subspaces. However,
[72x341]determining the optimal number of additional entangled pairs required by the entanglement
[72x320]purification technique to meet the uncertain requirements of fidelity values needed by quantum
[72x300]applications is challenging and has been overlooked in the literature.
[84x279]To overcome the challenges discussed above, in this paper, we propose an entangled pair
[72x258]and qubit resource management model in QCC. We focus on entangled pair resource allocation
[72x237]and fidelity-guaranteed entanglement routing in quantum networks, together with qubit resource
[72x216]allocation for quantum applications on quantum computers of the QCC providers. Specifically,
[72x196]we formulate the two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the optimal number
[72x175]of entangled pairs and the optimal number of qubits that can fulfill all requests from multiple
[72x154]quantum source nodes (i.e., users) and quantum destination nodes (i.e., providers). In the opti-
[72x133]mization problem, the uncertainties of fidelity requirements, the number of qubits, and the waiting
[72x112]time for quantum applications are taken into consideration. In addition, we apply the Benders
[72x92]decomposition algorithm to reduce both the complexity and execution time of the problem. The
[72x71]goal of the proposed model is to make optimal decisions for quantum applications in minimizing
