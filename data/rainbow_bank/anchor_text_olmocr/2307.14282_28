[72x709]impose the UMAS assumption. Reassuringly, estimates show that admission to the case-study
[72x693]program, Business Administration at PUC Santiago, increases students' probability to graduate
[72x676]from that program. The effect is particularly strong for those whose next-preferred alternative is
[72x660]Economics at UChile or Social Sciences and Humanities at PUC Santiago.
[89x643]Admission to our case-study program also strongly decreases students' probability to reapply
[72x627]through the centralized system in subsequent years for students whose local next-preferred option is
[72x610]Science and Engineering at UChile, Economics at UChile, or Social Sciences and Humanities at PUC
[72x594]Santiago. Interestingly, for students with the latter two next-best alternatives, it also decreases the
[72x578]probability to graduate from any program. For students whose next-best alternative is Science &
[72x561]Engineering at UChile, the naive estimate indicates a small negative effect on graduation from any
[72x545]program while our bounds show that this effect cannot be signed and may be 50 times larger in
[72x528]magnitude. Bounds do suggest that admission to Business Administration at PUC Santiago has a
[72x512]negative effect on reapplication for these students. While we generally see magnitudes of 0.1 or 0.2
[72x495]in the effects on graduation from Business Administration or any program, we see much smaller
[72x479]magnitudes on the students' probability to graduate from a STEM program â€”which is reassuring
[72x463]given that our definition of STEM does not include Business Administration. Finally, we find a
[72x446]strong positive effect on the probability to graduate from a top institution for those whose local
[72x430]next-best alternative is Law or Social Sciences and Humanities at PUC Santiago.
[72x391]6 Conclusion
[89x364]Centralized mechanisms for the assignment of students to educational programs are growing
[72x348]in popularity across the world. These systems provide a valuable source of exogenous variation
[72x331]through discontinuities around admission cutoffs. This along with individual-level data on admis-
[72x315]sions, preferences, and future outcomes allow researchers to identify a wide range of causal effects of
[72x298]education on outcomes. The variation is useful for identification as long as we control for students'
[72x282]true preferences; however, true preferences generally differ from what students report to the mech-
[72x266]anism given that most implementations of mechanisms generate incentives for students to behave
[72x249]strategically.
[89x233]This paper provides a novel approach to partially identify effects from mechanism assignment
[72x216]on future outcomes that is robust to strategic behavior. We illustrate our approach using data
[72x200]from a deferred-acceptance mechanism that assigns roughly 70,000 students to more than 1,000
[72x183]university-major programs every year in Chile. First, we find substantial evidence of strategic
[72x167]behavior which confirms earlier findings from the literature on Chile. Second, we compute bounds
[72x151]on the average effect of program assignment on graduation outcomes. We do so for students whose
[72x134]scores are marginal to the cutoff of admission into one of the most popular and selective programs
[72x118]in the system: business administration at the Catholic University of Santiago. Although admission
[72x101]into this program increases the likelihood of graduating from that same program, its effect on the
[72x85]likelihood of ever graduating from university varies depending on what students prefer as their
