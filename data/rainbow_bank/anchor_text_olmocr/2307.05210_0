[199x337]Abstract
[75x323]We study unique continuation over an interface using a stabilized unfitted
[75x312]finite element method tailored to the conditional stability of the problem.
[75x301]The interface is approximated using an isoparametric transformation of
[75x290]the background mesh and the corresponding geometrical error is included
[75x279]in our error analysis. To counter possible destabilizing effects caused by
[75x268]non-conformity of the discretization and cope with the interface condi-
[75x257]tions, we introduce adapted regularization terms. This allows to derive
[75x246]error estimates based on conditional stability. Numerical experiments
[75x235]suggest that the presence of an interface seems to be of minor impor-
[75x224]tance for the continuation of the solution beyond the data domain. On
[75x213]the other hand, certain convexity properties of the geometry are crucial
[75x202]as has already been observed for many other problems without interfaces.
