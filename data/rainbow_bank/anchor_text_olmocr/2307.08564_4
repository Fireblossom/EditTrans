[72x603]regulations that prevent them from using AI as a tool to level the playing field.

[72x626]attempts to promote new norms. The case of students demanding better regulation for the use of AI in

[72x686]of a minority view. The range of cases in which critical mass theory may work is somehow fuzzy, and
[72x698]the actions of a minority group trigger a cascade of behaviour change that rapidly increases the acceptance
[72x710]as a "critical mass"—the social system crosses a tipping point \[34–36\]. Once the tipping point is reached,
[72x722]individuals committed to overturn the existing norm reaches a critical group size—commonly referred to
