One finds that in the classical frustrated regime the observed spins patterns are determined by a single parameter \(E_{J}(\alpha)/k_{B}T\), and one can identify two distinguished regimes. The first one is realized in the hightemperature limit, \(k_{B}T\gg E_{J}(\alpha)\), in which all distributions of spins have the same probabilities and we have _disordered_ spin configuration. In the low-temperature regime, \(k_{B}T\ll E_{J}(\alpha)\)the spins patterns demonstrate a specific ordering determined by the anisotropic and longranged interaction strength \(\mathcal{F}^{cl}_{int}\). 

To quantitatively characterize the order-disorder phase transition for the Kagome lattice of a small size we counted all spin configurations and obtain the temperature dependence ce of a sp atially averaged spins polarization \(\overline{m}(T)=\sqrt{<M^{2}>}\), where \(<M^{2}>=\sum_{M}P_{M}M^{2}\)and \(M=(1/N)(\sum_{ij;\pm}\sigma_{ij;\pm})\)

. The \(P_{M}\) is the probability of a spin pattern with the spin polarization \(M\), and it is determined by the partition function \(Z^{cl}\). Here, \(N\) is the total number of triangles. The obtained dependencies of \(\overline{m}(T)\)for the Kagome lattice of different sizes \(N\) are presented in the Fig. 5. All curves show the maximum for \(k_{B}T/E_{J}(\alpha)\simeq 1\)indicating the crossover between the ordered and disordered spins phases. 

Since in the high-temperature limit \(P_{M=2n-N}\simeq C^{N}_{n}/2^{N}\), where \(n\)is the number of of iangles with the spin \(\sigma=+1\), we obtain \(\overline{m}(T)=1/\sqrt{N}\) (see dotted lines in Fig. 5). In the low-temperature limit as it was shown in Ref. [43] the spin patterns become highly anisotropic, and their number drastically reduces from \(2^{N}\)to \(2^{\sqrt{N}}\)

value. Moreover, only few spin patterns give non-zero contribution to the spin polarization \(m\), and the value of \(\overline{m}\) reduces substantially with \(N\) in this limit (see, Fig. 5). 

As we turn to the _ infinite_  Kagome lattice the interaction strength between spins shows highly anisotropic behavior. The interaction term, \(G^{\pm\pm}\), becomes spatially local one, and does not contribute to the classical partition function (20). The interaction strengths \(G^{\mp\pm}\)are written as (the details of calculations are presented in Appendix B) 

Gℓ⁢m;ℓ′⁢m′+−|m−m′=ℓ′−ℓ−1=−12⁢12|ℓ′−ℓ|,Gℓ⁢m;ℓ′⁢m′+−|m−m′=0=−12⁢12|ℓ−ℓ′|,Gℓ⁢m;ℓ′⁢m′+−|m′−m≈(ℓ−ℓ′)/2∝2⁢2(|ℓ−ℓ′|)1/2⁢π (22)  

The two-dimensional color plot of \(G_{\vec{\rho}\vec{\rho^{\prime}}}^{+-(-+)}\)is presented in Fig. 6, where both algebraic and exponential decay of the interaction strengths in vertical and horizontal directions is seen. Moreover, the interaction \(G_{00;\ell m}^{-+}\)( \(G_{\ell m;00}^{+-}\)) is absent in upper (lower) part of the lattice. 

## THE COHERENT QUANTUM REGIME 

In the limit \(k_{B}T\ll\hbar\Omega\)the quantum fluctuations, and therefore, non-zero Matsubara frequencies in Eq.(15) start to play an important role. Calculating the sum over the Matsubara frequencies in Eq.(15) we obtain that a spatially local term \(\propto\mathcal{F}_{0}\) produces the interaction in the imaginary time domain as \(\sigma(\tau_{i})\sigma(\tau_{j})\), where FIG. 4. Topological constraint \(C_{lm}=0\)for a single hexagon loop. The Josephson phase \(\varphi_{\ell,m}\) and spin degree of freedom \(\sigma\) are shown.
