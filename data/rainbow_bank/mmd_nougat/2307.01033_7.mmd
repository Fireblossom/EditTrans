is imposed to allow for \(X_{i1}\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(X_{i1}X_{j1}\), \(i,j\in[p]\), to not be sub-Gaussian, sub-exponential random variables. In financial settings, the state variables and idiosyncratic errors may be heavy-tailed, such that the sub-Gaussianity or sub-exponentiality property is restrictive. Condition MOM may be rewritten to allow for different order of moment bounds on the random variables \(X_{i1}\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(X_{i1}X_{j1}\), \(i,j\in[p]\), at the cost of more involved notation. This condition is also weaker than imposing the sub-Weibull property of Wong et al. (2020). 

Condition  Let  \(\bar{\beta}(k)\leq Bk^{-\mu}\)\(\bar{\beta}(k)\leq Bk^{-\mu}\), for some constants \(B\geq 0\)and \(\mu>2\).  Moreover, let \(a_{T}=\lceil T^{1/(1+\mu^{\prime})}\rceil\)and \(d_{T}=\lfloor T/(2a_{T})\rfloor\)for some \(\mu^{\prime}\in(0,\mu)\). Finally, 

\(pd_{T}a_{T}^{-\mu}=o(1)\) if \(B>0\); \(s_{0}\frac{(pa_{T})^{2/q}}{d_{T}^{(q-1)/q}}=o(1)\); \(s_{0}\frac{\sqrt{\log(pa_{T})}}{\sqrt{d_{T}}}=o(1)\); \(\|\hat{Y}-\tilde{Y}\|_{2}^{2}/T=o_{P}(1)\). 

Finally, Condition R imposes rates on the parameters \(s_{0}\), \(p\), \(T\), and the prediction error \(\|\hat{Y}-\tilde{Y}\|_{2}^{2}/T\). Conditions R.1 is a consequence of the time-series features of the data and need not be imposed for iid data. Condition R.2 reflects the polynomial tail part in the Fuk-Nagaev inequality for the maxima of high-dimensional sums and is required if \(X_{i1}\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(X_{i1}X_{j1}\) are not sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential random variables, for any \(i,j\in[p]\). From Condition MOM we observe that, if the value of \(q\) increases, such that the random variables satisfy stricter moment conditions, Condition R.2 becomes less restrictive on the rates of \(s_{0}\) and \(p\). Condition R.3 is the standard exponential rate imposed in the LASSO problem if \(X_{i1}\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(X_{i1}X_{j1}\) are iid sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential random variables, for each \(i,j\in[p]\). Finally, Condition R.4 requires that the estimation error in the auxiliary conditional variable converges to zero in probability. 

Condition R introduces the terms \(a_{T}\) and \(d_{T}\) , which depend on \(T\) and a parameter \(\mu^{\prime}\). Moreover, the parameter \(\mu\) describes the dependence in the data and is large if dependence is low. The value of \(\mu^{\prime}\)may be chosen close to \(\mu\), such that \(d_{T}\) may be set approximately equal to \(T\) if dependence is low. Given the choice of penalty parameter \(\lambda\) below, there is a trade-off between the convergence rates of the estimator and predictions (see Lemma 1) and the rates of the parameters. The convergence rate improves for large \(d_{T}\) and small \(a_{T}\) , such that we like to choose \(\mu^{\prime}\)large. On the other hand, Condition R.1 restricts \(p\) more for small \(d_{T}\) and large \(a_{T}\) ,
