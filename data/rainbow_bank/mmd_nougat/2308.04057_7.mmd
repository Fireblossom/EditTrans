Assumption A.1 is standard in the literature and it is similar to Assumption 1 in Pesaran (2006) which excludes non-stationary factors and trends. Assumption A.2 is the so-called rank condition and states that the number of factors must be smaller or at most equal to the number of regressors. This assumption is standard in the CCE literature and appears in Pesaran (2006) and in Karavias et al. (2022). Applied research typically finds a small number of factors in the error term, see e.g. Juodis and Sarafidis (2022). To further relieve the strain of the rank condition on the number of regressors, notice that some factors in \(f_{t}\) may be observable. Observed factors such as the intercept, time effects, seasonal dummies, and other common variables like index stock returns, central bank interest rates and oil prices should be included in \(X_{i}\). Any factor included in \(X_{i}\) does not count towards the dimension \(m\) of \(F\). When it comes to the factor loadings, we follow Westerlund and Kaddoura (2022) and assume that \(\lambda_{i}\)and \(\Pi_{i}\) are fixed in our setting, unlike Pesaran (2006), which assumes that they are random and independent of each other, which is much stronger. 

Assumption A.3 states that the heterogeneous coefficients are randomly distributed across units and are independent of any other random elements in the model. This is the prevalent assumption in the heterogeneous coefficients literature, see e.g. Pesaran (2006) and Chudik and Pesaran (2013). Assumption A.4 is similar to Assumption 2 of Pesaran (2006) and states that the series must be stationary and that the cross-sectional dependence across units is fully captured by the factor structure. The \(\rho\) mixing assumption controls the degree of time series dependence and is weaker than uniform mixing, yet stronger than strong mixing. This assumption also implies that \(\rho_{m}=O(\rho^{m})\)with \(|\rho|<1\). 

Assumption A.5 is the typical zero-mean assumption made for errors, similar to Pesaran (2006). We require the errors to be a martingale difference sequence to avoid bias in  \(\hat{\theta}_{i}(\gamma)\)\(\hat{\theta}_{i}(\gamma)\). The series \((x_{i,t},q_{i,t})\)are treated as strictly exogenous variables conditional on \(\mathscr{D}\). Furthermore, \(\xi_{i,t}\) is mean independent with respect to both future and past \(x_{i,t},q_{i,t}\) conditional on \(\mathscr{D}\). Finally, \(\varepsilon_{i,t}\) and \(\xi_{j,t}\)
