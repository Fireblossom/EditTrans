by the SG measurement on \(A\). 2 2 Note that event by event, it not possible to determine the polarisation of \(B\) from the kinematical configNamely, if we perform the experiment on an ensemble of uration of its decay products. identical \(f_{A}f_{B}\) pairs, selecting those pairs for which a specific value \(s\) is obtained in the SG measurement, the angular distribution of the decay products of \(B\) will follow the pattern that corresponds to the density operator (1). 

But, what if the SG measurement on \(A\) is performed _ after_  the decay of \(B\)? In terms of spin, the decay of a particle is not in general a ‘measurement’ that makes the system jump into a definite state. An experimental demonstration of this fact may eventually be provided by the post-decay entanglement measurements proposed in Ref. [2]. Then, if the first decay does not ‘collapse’ the entangled state, one is led to conclude that it is the later SG measurement on \(A\) that projects the spin state of the \(f_{A}f_{B}\) pair — for particle \(B\), it projects the state before its decay. It is worth clarifying here that the probability to obtain either result for \(A\)depends itself on the kinematics of the \(B\) decay (this point will be further discussed in the following). To illustrate this point, let us consider a _ gedankenexperiment_  with \(A\) and \(B\) in a spin-singlet state, 

\[|\Psi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[|{\small+}\rangle_{A}|{\small-}\rangle_{B }-|{\small-}\rangle_{A}|{\small+}\rangle_{B}\right]\,,\] (2)  

where we label the spin-up and spin-down states as \(|{\small+}\rangle\)and \(|{\small-}\rangle\), as usual. If \(B\) decay products are in an (idealised) kinematical configuration that univocally corresponds to the \(|{\small+}\rangle\)state, the SG measurement on \(A\) would certainly obtain the value \(|{\small-}\rangle\). But, despite this partial influence of the prior \(B\) decay on the later SG result, the post-selection is quite intriguing. And the fact that a later measurement determines the spin of the already decayed particle is also rather counter-intuitive, unless one admits a many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, such as that of Everett [3]. A previous post-tag proposal has been made for flavour entanglement in the \(K^{0}-\bar{K}^{0}\)system [4]. In that case, however, there are other ingredients that complicate the interpretation, such as time evolution and kaon mixing, and the fact that kaon decays filter the state of the entangled pair. 

In order to perform experimental tests of this post-selection one needs to consider a fermion with a lifetime large enough to allow it to travel macroscopic distances before decaying. The muon, with a mass \(m_{\mu}=105\) MeV and a lifetime of \(2.2\times 10^{-6}\)s at rest, seems a suitable candidate, even without significant time dilation effects to increase its decay length. For example, with an energy of twice its mass, the mean decay length is around 1.1 Km. (The \(\tau\)lepton has a much shorter lifetime of \(2.9\times 10^{-13}\), and even if produced at multi-TeV energies, the decay length is of the order of 10 cm.) Muons are highly penetrating through matter, which is also an advantage to minimise possible decoherence effects. 

In the following we describe how this post-selection could be experimentally probed. In sections 2 and 3 we calculate in turn the density operator for \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)pairs resulting from the decay of a scalar, and for \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)pairs produced in low-energy electron-positron collisions, identifying the kinematical setups that provide maximally-entangled states and would allow
