\(\succ^{\prime}\)is the profile of priority orders that are adjusted by a priority-based affirmative action policy. Since the policy is aim to create more opportunities for minority students, \(\succ^{\prime}\)must be an improvement of \(\succ\)for the minority students. 

We provide an example to understand the definitions. 

### Example 3 

Let \(I=\left\{i_{1},\cdots,i_{6}\right\}\) and \(S=\left\{s\right\}\). Here, we assume that \(i_{1},\cdots,i_{4}\) are minority students and \(i_{5},i_{6}\) are majority students. The score of the entrance exam for school \(s\in S\) of student \(i\) is given by \(\sigma_{i}\). Let 

\[\left(\sigma_{i_{1}},\cdots,\sigma_{i_{6}}\right)=\left(615,654,635,664,643,70 1\right).\]  

First, we let \(\succ_{s}\) be the priority order that simply determined by the scores; that is, 

≻s1:i6i4i2i5i3i1.  

On the other hand, we consider some bonus points for the minority students. Let \(\alpha_{i}\) be the bonus point for student \(i\) and 

\[\alpha = \left(\alpha_{i_{1}},\cdots,\alpha_{i_{6}}\right)=\left(50,50,10, 10,0,0\right),\] \[\alpha^{\prime} = \left(\alpha_{i_{1}}^{\prime},\cdots,\alpha_{i_{6}}^{\prime} \right)=\left(50,50,30,30,0,0\right),\] \[\alpha^{\prime\prime} = \left(\alpha_{i_{1}}^{\prime\prime},\cdots,\alpha_{i_{6}}^{\prime \prime}\right)=\left(60,60,10,10,0,0\right).\]  

With the bonus points profile \(\alpha,\alpha^{\prime}\)and \(\alpha^{\prime\prime}\), the priority order \(\succ_{s}^{2},\succ_{s}^{3}\)and \(\succ_{s}^{4}\)are respectively such that 

≻s2:i2i6i4i1i5i3, ≻s3:i2i6i4i3i1i5, ≻s4:i2i6i1i4i5i3.  

Then, \(\succ^{2}\), \(\succ^{3}\)and \(\succ^{4}\)are improvements of \(\succ^{1}\)for \(\left\{i_{1},\cdots,i_{4}\right\}\). 

In this section, we fix the profile of original priority orders \(\succ\)and the improved students \(I^{\prime}\subseteq I,\) and let 

\[\vartriangleright_{s}^{\prime} = \left\{\succ_{s},\succ_{s}^{\prime}\right\},\text{ } \vartriangleright_{s}^{\prime\prime}=\left\{\succ_{s},\succ_{s}^{\prime\prime} \right\},\] \[\vartriangleright^{\prime} = \left(\vartriangleright_{s}^{\prime}\right)_{s\in S},\text{ } \vartriangleright^{\prime\prime}=\left(\vartriangleright_{s}^{\prime\prime} \right)_{s\in S},\]  

where \(\succ^{\prime}\)and \(\succ^{\prime\prime}\)are improvements of \(\succ\)for \(I^{\prime}\subseteq I\). 

Then, we have the following result.
