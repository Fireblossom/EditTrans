gle photon output with a temporal width of 30 ns at a repetition rate of 670 kHz. A Fabry-P´erot filter removes residual optical excitation light from the emitted photons, resulting in a final single photon generation efficiency of \(\eta=5.0\pm 0.1\%\)within a 75 ns collection window. 

Next, we convert these single photons to the telecom O-band using a custom-fabricated PPLN waveguide device (see Supplemental Material). Our input fields are a pump laser at 1623 nm amplified by a fiber amplifier and a 737 nm signal, either from a laser for QFC efficiency characterization, or from the output of our SiV emission setup for single-photon conversion experiments. An aspheric lens couples both fields into separate waveguide modes of the PPLN, where an on-chip wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) combines the two modes. The PPLN waveguide output is collimated by a second aspheric lens, and residual pump light is removed by a 25 nm bandpass filter followed by a Pellin-Broca prism with a pinhole after 40 cm of propagation length. Finally, the converted light is sent through a fine filter setup comprising a circulator and a 50-GHz-bandwidth fiber Bragg grating to remove broadband anti-Stokes Raman noise. 

In the strong-pump limit, the total external conversion efficiency is dependent on the pump power in the waveguide \(P\) and the length of the interaction region \(L\) [25]: 

\[\eta_{\text{ext}}=\eta_{\text{opt}}\eta_{\text{int}}\sin^{2}\left(L\sqrt{\eta_ {0}P}\right),\] (1)  

where \(\eta_{\text{opt}}\) is the combined efficiency of all optical components and filtering, \(\eta_{\text{int}}\) is the maximum internal conversion efficiency of the PPLN, and \(\eta_{0}\) is the normalized internal efficiency, which is determined by the nonlinear material, mode overlap, etc. We measure \(\eta_{\text{opt}}\approx 19\%\), limited by coupling losses between the crystal waveguide mode and optical fiber (32% total) and the fiber Bragg filter (59%). By measuring the maximum depletion of the input 737 nm signal, we estimate an internal efficiency \(\eta_{\text{int}}\approx 65\%\). Sweeping the pump power (Fig. 2(b)) and fitting the 1350 nm output power to Eq. 1 shows a maximum conversion efficiency of \(\eta_{\text{ext}}=12.2\pm 0.1\%\), consistent with the losses described above. This conversion is maximized at an internal pump power of approximately 130 mW, which for our interaction length \(L=35~{}\)mm indicates a normalized internal efficiency \(\eta_{0}\approx 1.54\times 10^{4}\)W _-1_m _-2_. These figures are comparable to existing demonstrations [17, 26–28], and could be improved by further optimization of our coupling and device efficiency. 

We probe the noise generated by the strong pump by measuring the setup output on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) with zero 737 nm input power, plotted in Fig. 2(b) after correction for the SNSPD detection efficiency. The noise profile fits to a linear dependency of \(6.8\pm 0.9\)Hz/mW of noise photons generated by the pump, indicating anti-Stokes Raman scattering is the primary source. This noise reaches a count rate of \(1.0\pm 0.1\)kHz when the conversion efficiency is at its maximum. Due to the broadband nature of this pump-induced noise, a useful metric is the noise spectral density at maximum conversion \({\rho=21\pm 2}\)Hz/GHz, which compares favorably to other systems designed for diamond defect centers [29] and indicates the ultimate FIG. 2. (a) An SiV in emission modality is driven to produce single photons near 737 nm, which are efficiently collected by an overcoupled nanophotonic cavity then filtered from the driving fields with a free-space Fabry-P´erot cavity before being sent to a frequency downconversion setup. A pump laser at 1623 nm is amplified by a fiber amplifier (BKtel photonics) then coupled to free space. Half- and quarter-waveplates on both the pump and signal paths optimize coupling into the TE mode of the PPLN waveguide. The pump and signal are overlapped on a dichroic mirror (DM) and coupled into the PPLN waveguide where conversion occurs. The converted output is collected and filtered by a 25-nm-bandwidth bandpass filter (BPF), a Pellin-Broca prism, and ultimately a 50 GHz filter formed by a circulator and fiber Bragg grating (FBG). (b) Total external conversion efficiency (green) measured using a classical 737 nm input, and pump-induced noise (blue) as a function of pump power inside the PPLN waveguide. The noise shown here is calculated for the output of the conversion setup, accounting for the efficiency and dark counts of our SNSPDs.
