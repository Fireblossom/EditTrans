and \(x\sqsubseteq y\) implies \(y^{\perp}\sqsubseteq x^{\perp}\). It follows that \(\perp\)is an orthocomplementation on \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\). As we have seen, each element \(x\in\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)is the join \(x=\bigsqcup_{\mathbb{N}}x^{n}\) of elements of \(\mathcal{K}(L)\). So the ortholattice \(\mathcal{K}(L)\)is join-dense in the complete ortholattice \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\), and therefore it is meetdense as well. Being a join- and meet-dense subalgebra of a complete  ol  characterizes the MacNeille completion up to isomorphism, so \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)is the MacNeille completion of \(\mathcal{K}(L)\). 

**Proposition 3.14.** _ If_ \(L\)_ is an_ \((\omega+1)\)_-lattice, then_ \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)_ is a complete_  oml _._ 

_Proof._  Any chain in \(L\) has a least upper bound in \(L\) since it is either finite or it is infinite and therefore h \(1\)as s its join. Thus \(L\) is a complete lattice. So by Theorem ** ??** , the MacNeille completion \(\overline{\mathcal{K}(L)}\)is an  oml . By Proposition ** ??** , \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)is the MacNeille completion of \(\mathcal{K}(L)\)and therefore is a complete  oml . 

Now that we know that \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)is a complete  oml , we can state the following result that is a consequence of Corollary ** ??**  and Lemma ** ??** . 

**Corollary 3.15.** _ If_ \(L\)_ is an_ \((\omega+1)\)_-lattice and_ \(C\)_ is a bounded subchain of_ \(L\)_, then_ \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)_ is_ _a complete Boolean subalgeba of_ \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)

_Proof._ Let \((x^{i})_{I}\) be a family in \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)and \(x\) be the join of this family in the complete Boolean algebra \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\). Set \(D=\bigcup_{I}x^{i}\cup\{0,1\}\). By Corollary ** ??**  we have that \(x\) is the join of this family in \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(D)\), and by Lemma ** ??** , \(x\) is the join of this family in \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\). So \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)is closed under joins in \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\), and it is clearly closed under the operation \(\perp\)of \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)also. 

For the following result we recall that the _ commutator_  of elements \(x,y\) in an  oml  is given by \(\gamma(x,y)=(x\lor y)\wedge(x\lor y^{\perp})\wedge(x^{\perp}\lor y)\wedge(x^{ \perp}\lor y^{\perp})\). It has the property that \(\gamma(x,y)=0\)if \(x\) and \(y\) commute, similar to the way elements of a group commute iff their group-theoretic commutator is the identity. See [ ?KalmbachBook ] for details. 

Lemma _ If_ \(L\)_ is an_ \((\omega+1)\)_-lattice and_ \(x,y\in\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)_, then_ \(x\)_ and_ \(y\)_ commute iff_ \(x\cup y\)_is a chain. Thus the blocks of_ \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)_ are the sets_ \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)_ where_ \(C\)_ is a maximal chain of_ \(L\)_._ 

_Proof._  For \(x\in\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\)the terms of \(x\) and \(x^{\perp}\)are the same except possibly the bounds. Assume that \(x\cup y\) is not a chain. Then, there are terms \(u\) of \(x\) and \(v\) of \(y\) that are incomparable. Clearly \(u,v\not\in\{0,1\}\), and therefore \(u\) is also a term of \(x^{\perp}\)and \(v\) is a term of \(y^{\perp}\). Let \(z\) be the sequence \(u\wedge v<u\lor v\). We show that the sequence \(z\) is below \(\gamma(x,y)\)or equivalently below each of the sequences \(x\sqcup y\), \(x\sqcup y^{\perp}\), \(x^{\perp}\sqcup y\), and \(x^{\perp}\sqcup y^{\perp}\). Let \(w=x\sqcup y\). Then there are \(m,n<\ell(w)\)with \(w_{2m}\leqslant u\leqslant w_{2m+1}\) and \(w_{2n}\leqslant v\leqslant w_{2n+1}\). Since \(u\) and \(v\) are incomparable we must have \(m=n\) and therefore there exists an \(n<\ell(w)\)with \(w_{2n}\leqslant u\wedge v<u\lor v\leqslant w_{2n+1}\). So \(z\sqsubseteq w=x\sqcup y\). Similarly, \(z\sqsubseteq x\sqcup y^{\perp},x^{\perp}\sqcup y,x^{\perp}\sqcup y^{\perp}\). We conclude that \(0\neq z\sqsubseteq\gamma(x,y)\), that is, that \(x\) and \(y\) do not commute. 

For the converse, if \(x\cup y\) is a chain, it is contained in some bounded chain \(C\) of \(L\). Then \(x,y\) are contained in the Boolean algebra \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\). By Corollary ** ??** , \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)is a Boolean subalgebra of \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\). Thus \(x\) and \(y\) commute. 

For the further comment, suppose \(B\) is a Boolean subalgebra of \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\). Then we have that \(D=\bigcup\{x:x\in B\}\) is a chain in \(L\). Extending \(D\) to a maximal chain \(C\) in \(L\) we have \(B\subseteq\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)and \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)is a Boolean subalgebra of \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\). So if \(B\) is a block, \(B=\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)for some maximal chain \(C\) of \(L\). It remains to show that if \(C\) is a maximal chain of \(L\)then \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)is a block. Suppose that \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(C)\)is contained in a Boolean subalgebra \(B\) of \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(L)\). Then \(B\) is contained in \(\mathcal{K}^{*}(D)\)for some maximal chain \(D\) in \(L\). It is easily seen that
