## Appendix B: Numerical results for \(r=2\)

In this section, we present additional numerical results for the East model with range \(r=2\). We will see that the essential physics discussed in the main text is independent of the range \(r\). 

We start by showing our diagnostics for the phase transition in Fig.  6 . Notice that in this case, we do not have analytic expressions for the size of the largest Krylov sector as in the case of \(r=1\). So we implement the recursive algorithm outlined in the main text, which works independent of the range \(r\). The ratio \(D_{\rm max}/D_{\rm sum}\) exhibits a qualitative change at the critial density \(n_{c}\approx 0.33\)[Fig.  6 (a)]. For \(n<n_{c}\), the largest Krylov sector constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the full symmetry sector in the thermodynamic limit, indicative of strong fragmentation. The ratio decays exponentially with \(L\) upon increasing system size in this regime [Fig.  6 (b)]. For \(n>n_{c}\), the ratio approaches order one, indicating weak fragmentation, and the system thermalizes with high probability from a random initial state. At the critical point, \(D_{\rm max}/D_{\rm sum}\) again shows a power-law decay with system size as \(L^{-1}\). We can similarly consider the fraction of frozen sites averaged over all configurations in a symmetry sector as a function of the filling, which serves as an order parameter for the transition. This order parameter changes from zero to nonzero at the critical \(n_{c}\), as shown in Fig.  6 (d). Notice that the position of the critical point is again in excellent agreement with the general expression \(n_{c}=\frac{1}{r+1}\), which is equal to \(1/3\)for \(r=2\). 

We also consider the process of thermal inclusion in this case, for which numerical results are summarized in Fig.  7 . We find that the distribution of the sizes of the thermal bubble again obeys \(P(l)\sim l^{-3/2}\)for \(l<\xi\), and the correlation length itself diverges as \(\xi\sim(n_{c}-n)^{-\nu}\)with \(\nu\approx 2\). 

Finally, we confirm that charge transport is diffusive in the thermal phase by computing the autocorrelation function restricted to a specific symmetry sector, as shown in Fig.  8 . FIG. 5. Computing the size of the largest Krylov sector by mapping to the combinatorial problem of counting the number of allowed monotonic paths on a lattice. (a) \(n=0.5\); (b) \(n>0.5\). The paths connect the two green dots on the lattice, and are restricted within the yellow shaded region, i.e., they cannot touch or cross the red dashed line \(y=x+1\)(left pannel). We can count the number of disallowed paths by mapping such paths to those connecting the origin and the mirror-reflected point about the red line (orange paths in the right pannel).
