\(\Delta X\Delta P\geq\frac{\hbar}{2}\). One might think recovering the standard commutator (3) would not lead to a minimum length, but due to the modified behavior of  \({\hat{P}}\)\({\hat{P}}\), and therefore \(\Delta P\), one still finds a non-zero minimum distance. In conclusion, the crux of the question is if operators are capped or not. Physical operators must display ultraviolet convergence/finiteness. Uncapped operators have only a mathematical meaning, although can be used as auxiliary variables in calculations. The algebra of operators is per se irrelevant to discriminate the short distance nature of observables. 

## GENERALIZING TO THREE DIMENSIONS 

In this section, we generalize the above construction from one spatial dimension to three spatial dimensions. The modified operators must now become three-vector operators â€“ \({\hat{X}}\to{\hat{X}}_{i}\)\({\hat{X}}\to{\hat{X}}_{i}\)and \({\hat{P}}\to{\hat{P}}_{i}\)\({\hat{P}}\to{\hat{P}}_{i}\), where \(i=1,2,3\). This can be done by applying different conditions to the ansatz functions, \(G\) and \(H\) as we now discuss in detail. For the hyperbolic ansatz functions of (5), one could try letting 

\(H\left(\frac{p}{p_{M}}\right)=\frac{p_{M}}{p_{i}}\tanh\left(\frac{p_{i}}{p_{M} }\right)\), which gives a modified momentum of the form  \({\hat{P}}_{i}=p_{i}H\left(\frac{p}{p_{M}}\right)=p_{M}\tanh\left(\frac{p_{i}}{ p_{M}}\right)\)\({\hat{P}}_{i}=p_{i}H\left(\frac{p}{p_{M}}\right)=p_{M}\tanh\left(\frac{p_{i}}{ p_{M}}\right)\). This would have a low momentum limit of  \({\hat{P}}_{i}\approx p_{i}\)\({\hat{P}}_{i}\approx p_{i}\), and a high momentum limit of \(p_{M}\) in the direction of \(p_{i}\). The vector character of the modified position operator arises through \(\partial_{p}\to\partial_{p_{i}}\), and the ansatz function becomes \(G\left(\frac{p_{i}}{p_{M}}\right)=\cosh^{2}\left(\frac{p_{i}}{p_{M}}\right)\). In order to satisfy (4), the \(\cosh^{2}\)term for the modified position operator has to have the same functional dependence \(\tanh\)term in the modified momentum operator. Note that condition (4) becomes \(G\left(\frac{p_{i}}{p_{M}}\right)\partial_{p_{i}}\left[p_{j}H\left(\frac{p_{j} }{p_{M}}\right)\right]=\delta_{ij}\) in this three dimensional case. 

This approach has a fundamental problem, though. \(G\) and \(H\) are functions of \(p_{i}\), which spoils the rotational symmetry of the modified position and momentum operators, as discussed in section 6.2 of [7]. 

In order to preserve rotational symmetry and still retain the feature that the momentum operators have upper bounds of the form given in section II, we need ansatz functions of the form 

\[G\left(\frac{|{\vec{p}}|}{p_{M}}\right)=\cosh^{2}\left(\frac{|{\vec{p}}|}{p_{M }}\right)~{}~{}~{}~{}{\rm and}~{}~{}~{}~{}H\left(\frac{|{\vec{p}}|}{p_{M}} \right)=\frac{p_{M}}{|{\vec{p}}|}\tanh\left(\frac{|{\vec{p}}|}{p_{M}}\right)~{},\] (7)  

or for the arctan modification 

\[G\left(\frac{|{\vec{p}}|}{p_{M}}\right)=\left[1+\left(\frac{\pi|{\vec{p}}|}{2p _{M}}\right)^{2}\right]~{}~{}~{}~{}{\rm and}~{}~{}~{}~{}H\left(\frac{|{\vec{p} }|}{p_{M}}\right)=\frac{2p_{M}}{\pi|{\vec{p}}|}\arctan\left(\frac{\pi|{\vec{p} }|}{2p_{M}}\right)~{}.\] (8)
