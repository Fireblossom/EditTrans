is in everyone’s best interest to comply to it. Yet bottom-up processes can also lead to norm change. In particular, the so-called critical-mass theory states that when a minority of the population formed by individuals committed to overturn the existing norm reaches a critical group size—commonly referred to as a “critical mass”—the social system crosses a tipping point [ 34 – 36 ]. Once the tipping point is reached, the actions of a minority group trigger a cascade of behaviour change that rapidly increases the acceptance of a minority view. The range of cases in which critical mass theory may work is somehow fuzzy, and the framework has been used to account for changes concerning spontaneous conventions as well as formal regulations. Experimental results, obtained in the framework of the Naming Game model [ 32 ,  37 ], suggest that a critical mass of 25% of the population [ 38 ], while modelling indicated a lower threshold [ 36 ]. In the case of AI, if the current trend of (informal, so far) regulation continues, one may expect spontaneous attempts to promote new norms. The case of students demanding better regulation for the use of AI in higher education seems an easy first guess. Analogously, non-native English speakers could try and overturn regulations that prevent them from using AI as a tool to level the playing field. 

### Spontaneously emerging norms on AI, as seen by ChatGPT 

Within this framework, gathering data on the spontaneous processes currently shaping the norms around AI is difficult. But there’s a privileged point of view to observe how our behaviour has evolved in the first months of public LLM chats, namely the one of ChatGPT. Therefore, I report here two extracts of a conversation I had with the freely accessible chatbot on May 22, 2023. If this article can only hope to highlight potential scenarios for the ongoing yet still-in-its-infancy process of norm formation, the text below may perhaps acquire more interest for the future reader, as a testimony of what the machine was ‘thinking’ in these early days. It is evident that some of the points exposed by ChatGPT correspond to the desiderata of the programmers. Yet it is also possible to accept that some of the answers come from a genuine elaboration of the AI experience. 

After the the LLM clarified that its (‘its’? what is the norm here?) definition of norm corresponds the the one used throughout this piece, i.e. that a norm “is a widely accepted standard or expectation of behavior in a society or group”, it replied to my question on what emerging norms it has noted during the first months of its activity as reported below. 

While social norms may vary depending on cultural and individual factors, here are some general trends that can be observed: 


1. Politeness and Respect: Many people tend to interact with LLMs in a polite and respectfulmanner, treating them as intelligent entities. This includes using appropriate language, expressing gratitude, and avoiding derogatory or offensive remarks. 
2. Acknowledging Limitations: Social norms often involve recognizing that LLMs have limita-tions. Users understand that LLMs provide responses based on patterns and data but may not always possess contextual understanding or have access to real-time information. It is important for users to critically evaluate and verify information obtained from LLMs. 
3. Contextual Understanding: Users have started to recognize that LLMs may not fully graspthe nuances and complexities of certain topics or cultural contexts. Consequently, users are encouraged to provide additional context or clarification to ensure accurate and relevant responses. 
4. Responsible Use: As LLMs become more prevalent, there is a growing awareness of theimportance of responsible use. This includes not relying solely on LLMs for critical decisions, being cautious about potential biases in the training data, and understanding the ethical implications of using LLMs. 
5. Human-Machine Collaboration: Social norms are evolving to promote collaboration betweenhumans and LLMs. Users understand that LLMs can be valuable tools for information retrieval, idea generation, and learning. The norm is to view LLMs as partners rather than replacements, leveraging their strengths while recognizing the irreplaceable role of human creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. 
6. Privacy and Data Protection: Norms around privacy and data protection apply to inter-actions with LLMs as well. Users expect that their personal information and interactions
