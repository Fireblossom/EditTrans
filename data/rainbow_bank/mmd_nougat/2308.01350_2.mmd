thermal Griffiths regions acting as ergodic patches are expected to be present anyhow. In a chain of moderate size, we expect that a substantial fraction of samples appears to be localized simply by lack of ergodic regions. This would lead to a shift of the apparent critical disorder value $W_c$ for short chains if one compares the isolated chain to our model where we add a bubble by hand. In Fig.  2 , we compare the disorder averaged gap ratio $\overline{r}$ of adjacent energy gaps in the middle of the spectrum given of the isolated XXZ chain (right) to XXZ chain-bubble system (left) as a function of disorder strength $W$ for different system sizes $L$. Using the crossing of $\overline{r}$ of size $L$ and $L+2$as a proxy for the apparent critical point at this length scale, the inset shows that it is indeed the case that the crossings appear at slightly larger disorder strengths in the presence of the bubble. However, due to large statistical uncertainty and significant finite size effects, this crossing analysis is not a reliable way to pin down the critical point. 

## CHANGE OF LOCAL THERMALITY IN INTERACTING CHAINS 

We investigate the one-site purities $\gamma_i$ as a measure of local thermality. Throughout this paper, we consistently use the labels “localized” and “thermal” as inferred from the crossing point of $\overline{r}$ (see Fig.  2 ), i.e. with the critical point at $W\approx3.5-4$, even though recent works locate the transition at larger $W$. Inspecting the average purities in the presence and absence of the thermal bubble (see Fig.  3 ) is clear that the effect of the bubble at long distance is rather small and subtle. Therefore, it is useful to first map out what the theory of quantum avalanches predicts. 

**Theoretical background**  For a simple avalanche model of our setup, we assume the existence of an _ apparent_  lo

calization length $\xi$, describing the system in absence of the bubble, and a number $p$ giving the probability that the bubble can kickstart a thermalization process in its near vicinity, see Ref. [ 69 ] for a detailed discussion and arguments why $p \ll 1$in our setup. A simple model, based on an unrealistic dichotomy between ergodicity and localization, leads (see SM) to the following very rough prediction: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:toy_equation} (\bar\gamma_i-1/2) \approx (1-p)(1-e^{-|i|/\xi})(\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}-1/2}) + pd^{-1/2}_{\text{eff},i} \end{equation}\begin{equation}\label{eq:toy_equation} (\bar\gamma_i-1/2) \approx (1-p)(1-e^{-|i|/\xi})(\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}-1/2}) + pd^{-1/2}_{\text{eff},i} \end{equation}

with $\bar \gamma_i$$\bar \gamma_i$ the average purity at site $i$and $\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}}$$\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}}$ the average purity in the bubble-less system. For $p=0$, we recover a perfectly localized system, whereas for $p=1$, the system is ergodic but the average purity still increases with $i$, because the effective dimension $d_{\text{eff},i}$ depends on the distance to the bubble. This effective dimension is defined as $ d_{\text{eff},i}= e^{-2i/\xi} d_{\mathrm{therm}} $ with $d_{\mathrm{therm}}$ the total Hilbert space dimension of the thermal region, given by $d_{\mathrm{therm}}= n_\text{GOE}^{\frac{1}{1-\xi/\xi_*}}$if $\xi<\xi_*$and $d_{\mathrm{therm}}=n_\text{GOE}2^L$if $\xi>\xi_*$, where $\xi_*=1/\log 2$is the critical localization length.  According to the above formula Eq. ( 6 ), there are two regimes in which $\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}}-\bar \gamma_i$$\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}}-\bar \gamma_i$ does not decay to zero, or only very slowly. 

$\xi> \xi_*$. Here, the bubble thermalizes a fraction $p$of samples, resulting in a shift $\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}}-\bar \gamma_i$$\bar\gamma_{\mathrm{XXZ}}-\bar \gamma_i$ which remains finite as $i\to\infty$, even though it decreases due to the decrease of $d_{\text{eff},i}$. Average gap ratio [ 5 ] $\overline{r}$ for the disordered field XXZ spin chain of size $L$ coupled to a thermal bubble of size $n_\text{GOE}=4$(left) and the same system _ without_  bubble and chain length $L+2$(right).  Inset: Pair wise crossing of gap ratio $\overline{r}(W)$as function of $1/L$ for both systems.
