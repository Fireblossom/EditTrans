to prove Bob wrong is obtaining an early success, Ann is willing to work harder on her idea in the first period than she would do if Bob was like-minded. Clearly, the same holds for , one can easily see that \(e^{A}=e^{B}=e^{\mathcal{H}}(1+\beta e^{\mathcal{H}})>e^{\mathcal{H}}\). 15 15 The reader might have noticed that the optimal level of effort is the same as the one obtained when analyzing the single-technology case. In general, this will not always be the case. Each player is eager to prove the other wrong, hoping that they will join forces to pursue the most promising type of innovation in the future: disagreement makes the group work harder in the first period, pushing Ann and Bob’s average output above the level of Sam and Tom. 16 16 In practice this conclusion does not require us (the analyst) to be convinced that Tom holds the correct views: it is sufficient that both approaches work equally well, or that we believe that Ann and Bob are correct each with probability \(\frac{1}{2}\)

Finally note that, in the last illustrative example, we also expect both Ann and Bob to

The reason is that disagreement pushes players’ first-period effort closer to \(e^{\mathcal{H}}(1+\beta)\)the level of individual effort that is efficient taking externalities into account. Hence, in this specific example, not only does disagreement increase expected output, it also lead to a Pareto improvement in terms of expected payoffs. 

Our formal analysis, presented in sections 3-5 of this paper, generalizes, enriches and qualifies the intuitions presented in the previous toy examples. We extend the analysis to a wider class of utility functions, and consider any views \(\mathcal{H}\) and \(\mathcal{L}\), providing an intuitive condition that ensures that disagreement will drive up the effort of a player holding view \(\mathcal{H}\)as in the case of the views presented in table 1. We consider a more general model-switching rule, which allows for changes in mind after non-zero probability events. We also discuss the main assumption of our set-up and possible variations. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the literature on model change and disagreement. In section 3 we outline the general model. In section 4 we present the results for the single production technology case, while in section 5 we discuss the multiple technology case. In section 6 we discuss the robustness of our findings and changes of our key assumptions. Finally, in section 7 we draw the conclusions.
