### The character table of the projective Pauli group 

Since the \(n\)-qubit projective Pauli group is abelian it has only degree one irreducible characters. One-dimensional representations characters coincide since the trace leaves 1-by-1 matrices invariant. Elements of the \(n\)-qubit projective Pauli group have order at most 2. Thus, the character of an element of \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\) must be \(\pm 1\). \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\) is generated by \(\{[X_{1}],[Z_{1}],\dots,[X_{n}],[Z_{n}]\}\), where \([A_{j}]\)is the equivalence class of the Pauli operator \(A\) acting on the \(j^{\text{th}}\)qubit 

\[A_{j}=I_{2}^{\otimes j-1}\otimes A\otimes I_{2}^{\otimes n-j}.\]  

So a character of \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\) is fully determined by a choice of \(\pm 1\)for \([X_{i}]\)and \([Z_{i}]\)for each \(i\in\{1,\dots,n\}\). The choices for each qubit leave us with \(4^{n}\)choices for the whole group. There are \(4^{n}=|\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}|\) characters since \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\) is abelian and thus has only singleton conjugacy classes. Irreducible characters that disagree   on any one element must be distinct, so this completely determines the character table of \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\). Thus, the character table of \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)can be written by filling the first row and column of a \(4^{n}\)-by\(4^{n}\)table with   ones, then in the rest of each remaining row writing each permutation of \(\frac{4^{n}}{2}-1\)ones and \(\frac{4^{n}}{2}\)negative ones. 

## The inertia subgroup 

To begin our study of the character theory of the \(n\)-qubit Clifford quotient group, we examine the inertia subgroups of the representations of the \(n\)-qubit projective Pauli group in the \(n\)-qubit projective Clifford group. 

**Lemma 4.1.** _ Let_ \(\sigma\)_ and_ \(\rho\)_ be nontrivial irreducible representations of_ \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)_, then there exists_ \(g\in\mathcal{C}_{n}\)_ such_ _that_ \({}^{g}\sigma\sim\rho\)_. In other words, all nontrivial irreducible representations of_ \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)_ are conjugate in_ \(\mathcal{C}_{n}\)_._ 

_Proof._  We begin the proof by noticing that 

\[\begin{split}HXH^{-1}&=Z\\ HZH^{-1}&=X\\ HYH^{-1}&=-Y.\end{split}\  

So we have that conjugation of Pauli matrices by \(H\) maps \(X\) to \(Z\), and vice versa, while mapping \(Y\)to \(-Y\). Thus conjugation by \([H]\)maps \([X]\)to \([Z]\)and vice versa while leaving \([Y]\)invariant. We can calculate 

\[\begin{split}SXS^{-1}&=Y\\ SZS^{-1}&=Z\\ SYS^{-1}&=-X,\end{split}\  

thus conjugation by \([S]\)maps \([X]\)to \([Y]\)and vice versa while leaving \([Z]\)invariant. Furthermore conjugation by \([H][S][H]\)maps \([Z]\)to \([Y]\)and vice versa while leaving \([X]\)invariant. We see that we can permute the equivalence classes of the non-identity one-qubit Pauli matrices in any way via conjugation by elements of \(\mathcal{C}_{n}\). We now turn our attention to 2-qubit operators. Consider the swap gate, if \(A\) and \(B\) are any 2-by-2 matrices we have 

\[(SWAP)(A\otimes B)(SWAP)=B\otimes A.\]  

Our previous calculations for 1-qubit matrices tell us that any pair of nontrivial representations \(\sigma\)and \(\rho\) of \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)\(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\)that have the same number of pairs of generators ( \([X_{i}],[Z_{i}]\)) in their kernels, that is 

\[|\{i\in\{1,\dots,n\}:\rho([X_{i}])=\rho([Z_{i}])=1\}|=|\{i\in\{1,\dots,n\}: \sigma([X_{i}])=\sigma([Z_{i}])=-1\}|,\]
