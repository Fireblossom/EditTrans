least partly due to both the limited and the imperfect nature of the experimental data. Fig.  3  illustrates these training dynamics for the case where we are learning a ground state in the ordered checkerboard phase, but we observe that these trends also hold more broadly across the phase transition. Fig.  4 a and Fig.  4 b illustrate the outcomes of data-enhanced VMC for both the 1D RNNs and 2D RNNs for a variety of detuning values on either side of the critical coupling \(\delta_{c}/\Omega\). 

Fig.  4 a shows that, in some cases, the energies achieved by the 1D RNN are improved by over an order of magnitude when data-enhanced VMC is used as the training procedure, particularly in the ordered checkerboard regime. A similar effect was not observed in Ref. [ 22 ] because the method was tested at only one point in the phase diagram, close to a phase transition. The results here are consistent, in that the performance of variational optimization and data-enhanced VMC are comparable in the disordered phase and around the phase transition, with data-enhancement still providing a speedup in convergence time in these regimes. In addition to the accuracy improvements seen in the ground state energy estimates in the ordered regime (Fig.  4 a), we find that the use of data allows the 1D RNN wavefunction to capture the 2D ordering of the checkerboard phase, which it is unable to do when trained using the Hamiltonian alone. This might be understood since the data set, which is a set of projective measurement outcomes that are exemplary of the ground state or states close to it, contains a more explicit representation of the correlations between atoms in the array. Using this data in the earliest epochs of training optimizes the model to directly reflect this information. This early-phase training seems to be crucial in moving the gradient descent algorithm into a smaller subspace that can more easily be optimized by later-phase variational training. More details and discussion can be found in Appendix  D . 

Fig.  4 b shows that for the 2D RNN wavefunctions, Convergence of the estimated ground state energy \(H_{\mathrm{RNN}}\) for 1D and 2D RNN wavefunctions trained in a purely Hamiltonian-driven setting (blue), a purely data-driven setting (orange), and in the hybrid data- then Hamiltonian-driven setting (green). The target state is deep in the checkerboard phase ( \(\delta/\Omega=3.173\)), meaning it is highly ordered. The ground state energy given by quantum Monte Carlo is marked by the black dashed line. For hybrid training, the transition from data-driven to Hamiltonian-driven training is marked by the red dashed line. 

(a) The absolute error between the best estimated ground state energy achieved by trained 1D RNN wavefunctions \(H_{\mathrm{RNN}}\) and the ground state energy given by quantum Monte Carlo simulations \(H_{\mathrm{QMC}}\). (b) Convergence time \(t_{\mathrm{conv}}\) as a function of the transition point \(t_{\mathrm{trans}}\) in the hybrid training of 2D RNN wavefunction. The convergence time has been rescaled by the time it takes for the RNN to be trained purely variationally \(t_{\mathrm{VMC}}\), showing the relative speedup provided by data-enhancement. This is because \(t_{\mathrm{conv}}\) and \(t_{\mathrm{VMC}}\) depend on the value of \(\delta/\Omega\).
