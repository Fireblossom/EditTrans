to achieve with the exclusive exchange of classical information [2], [3]. Similar to a classical computer network, a quantum network is a distributed system composed of quantum computers and quantum repeaters that exchange quantum information across physical channels. Among applications supported by quantum networks, _ Distributed Quantum Computing_  (DQC) is of particular interest as it leverages the power of interconnected quantum computers to create a virtual quantum machine with processing capabilities that surpass its physical constituents alone [4]–[6]. DQC is general as it encompasses any distributed architecture for quantum computing, from the short-range interconnection of multiple _ Quantum Processing Units_  (QPUs) inside the same cooling device, to arbitrary-scale quantum data centers [7]. Furthermore, DQC offers a practical way to scale quantum computers in the _ Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum machines_ (NISQ) era [6]. Modular, distributed architectures facilitate the construction of large quantum machines by replacing the complexity of building a monolithic QPU with a large number of qubits with that of a machine consisting of an interconnection of simpler QPUs with fewer qubits [7]–[9]. 

When the quantum network scenario is considered, the complexity of distributed quantum computing extends in at least two dimensions. First, physical quantum channels have a well known depletion effect in the exchange of quantum data, e.g., an exponential decrease in channel entanglement rate with distance [10]. Second, there is a demand for a quantum network protocol capable of performing desired distributed quantum operations while accounting for network connectivity. Generic quantum computation with qubits in distinct quantum processors demands either the application of remote controlled gates [11] or the continuous exchange of quantum information. For both cases, a network protocol is necessary to orchestrate the communication between nodes that are not directly connected with one another. 

One challenge in the design of a control protocol is the need for it to be agnostic to hardware implementations. There is a plethora of physical systems suited for quantum computation under investigation, superconducting qubits [12], trapped ions [13], [14] and Silicon-vacancy color centers in diamond [15], [16] to name a few. In addition, there is a diverse investigation in the architectural description of quantum interconnecting devices capable of exchanging quantum information encoded in distinct quantum physical quantities [17]. This diverse ecosystem of quantum network technologies indicates that distributed quantum computing network protocols need to abstract physical implementations of quantum switches and network connectivity while maintaining universality requirements.
