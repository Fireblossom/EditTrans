there exists a \(\Delta_{j}\in\bar{\Delta}\), such that \(\Delta_{i}\cap\Delta_{j}\neq\varnothing\). We call \(\Delta_{i}\) as the ** sub-** **descriptor set** \(\Delta\), moreover, the sub-descriptor set and the states of them called a ** subsystem**  corresponding to the sub-descriptor set. Denote \(T=\{D_{t}|D_{t}\in\Delta_{i}\cap\Delta_{j},i,j=1,2,\cdots,X\}\) as ** transitional descriptor set** . Use |â‹…| to denote the number of elements of a set. We suppose that for all \(\Delta_{i}\cap\Delta_{j}=\varnothing\), for each \(D_{i}\in\Delta_{i},D_{j}\in\Delta_{j}\), we have \(D_{ij}=O\), it means the descriptors in non-overlapped sub-descriptor set do not have direct impact with each other. 

As we do not change the state of the descriptors when split the system into subsystems, we call the CIM corresponding to the subsystem corresponding to the sub-descriptor set as the CIM corresponding to the sub-descriptor set for short. 

For all the sub-descriptor set split from the descriptor set, we construct all the CIM corresponding to the sub-descriptor set, then, by applying the consistency algorithm, we acquire each ** consistent scenario set** \(S_{i}\). Denote \(\Xi=\{\{z_{1},z_{2},\cdots,z_{X}\}|z_{i}\in S_{i},i=1,2,\cdots X\}\) as the ** combinatorial consistent** **scenario set**  between the sub-descriptor sets, which \(\xi=\{z_{1},z_{2},\cdots,z_{X}\}\)called a ** combinatorial consistent scenario**  between the sub-descriptor sets, we call it as a ** combinatorial**  for short. 

When constructing the CIM of \(\Delta_{i}\), if it exists \(D_{i},D_{j}\in T\)and \(\Delta_{m},\Delta_{n}\in\Delta\)such that it holds \(D_{i},D_{j}\in\Delta_{m}\) and \(D_{i},D_{j}\in\Delta_{n}\) at the same time, then we must ensure that the judgement sections of \(D_{ij}\)in the CIM of \(\Delta_{m},\Delta_{n}\) must be the same. 

For \(T\)\(\Xi\), if \(\xi=\{z_{1},z_{2},\cdots,z_{X}\}\in\Xi\)meets 

\[\bigcup_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant X,i\neq j}({z_{i}}\cap{z_{j}})=|T|,\;{\text{ which}}\;z_{i}\in\xi\]  

then we say that combinatorial \(\xi\) can be ** aggregated**  into a consistent \(\Delta\), and for all such combinatorial \(\xi=\{z_{1},z_{2},\cdots,z_{X}\}\in\Xi\), the consistent scenarios of \(\Delta\)is \(z=\bigcup_{i=1}^{X}z_{i}\).
