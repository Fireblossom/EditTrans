_Model.‚Äî_  We consider Markovian open quantum systems weakly interacting with one or several thermal reservoirs, whose evolution is described by the Lindblad master equation ( \(\hbar=k_{B}=1\)): 

\[\dot{\rho_{t}}=\mathcal{L}(\rho_{t})=-i[H,\rho_{t}]+\sum_{k=1}^{K }\mathcal{D}[L_{k}]\rho_{t},\] (4)  \[\dot{\rho_{t}}=\mathcal{L}(\rho_{t})=-i[H,\rho_{t}]+\sum_{k=1}^{K }\mathcal{D}[L_{k}]\rho_{t},\] (4)  

where \(\rho_{t}\) is the density operator of the system, \(H\) its Hamiltonian, and \(\mathcal{D}[L]\rho=L\rho L^{\dagger}-\{L^{\dagger}L,\rho\}/2\) a dissipator describing irreversible processes triggered by the environment associated to a set of Lindblad or jump operators \(\{L_{k}\}\) (emission and absorption of quanta, dephasing, etc). Importantly both \(H\) and \(L_{k}\) can be timedependent, following the externally imposed variation of some parameter \(\lambda\) that follows a prescribed control protocol \(\Lambda:=\{\lambda(t);0\leqslant t\leqslant\tau\}\) up to some final time \(\tau\). We assume local detailed balance for the jump operators, i.e. every jump process is related to its inverse counterpart as \(L_{\tilde{k}}=L_{k}^{\dagger}e^{-\Delta s_{k}/2}\), which is also included in the set \(\{L_{k}\}\) [ 17 ]. Here \(\Delta s_{k}\) is the entropy change in the environment associated to the \(k\)th jump [ 57 ]. 

We further assume the system of interest to be initially prepared at time \(t=0\) in a pure state \(\ket{n}_{0}\) with probability \(p_{n}(0)\), as sampled from \(\rho_{0}=\sum_{n}p_{n}(0)\ket{n}\bra{n}_{0}\). Moreover, we introduce a final projective measurement at time \(\tau\) on the system using an arbitrary set of rank-1 projectors \(\{\ket{m}\bra{m}_{\tau}\}\), that is useful for the thermodynamic description at the level of fluctuations [ 25 ]. 

The dynamics described by the master equation ( 4 ) can be _ unravelled_  into quantum trajectories by introducing a continuous monitoring scheme [ 2 ], where a generalized measurement is performed on the system at every infinitesimal instant of time \(dt\), such that \(\rho_{t+dt}=\sum_{k}M_{k}\rho_{t}M_{k}^{\dagger}\)with measurement operators verifying \(\sum_{k}M_{k}^{\dagger}M_{k}=\openone\)\(\sum_{k}M_{k}^{\dagger}M_{k}=\openone\). For concreteness, we assume in the following a quantum jump unravelling, although the results derived here are generically valid for other schemes. Within this approach, the system evolution can be described by a sequence of smooth evolution periods intersected by abrupt _ jumps_  associated with operators \(L_{k}\), occurring  at  stochastic times. More precisely, we have \(M_{k}=\sqrt{dt}L_{k}\) with \(k=1...K\), for a detection of a jump of type \(k\) in the interval \([t,t+dt]\), and \(M_{0}=\openone-iHdt-dt\sum_{k}L_{k}^{\dagger}L_{k}/2\), for no-jumps during \(dt\). 

The above procedure is known to describe the state of the system conditioned on a given record of jumps detected during the evolution as a pure state \(\ket{\psi}_{t}\), following a stochastic Schr√∂dinger equation [ 2 ,  3 ]. Including the initial state and the final projection, we hence define the complete measurement record up to the final time \(\tau\) as \(\Gamma_{[0,\tau]}:=\{n,(t_{1},k_{1}),(t_{2},k_{2}),...,(t_{J},k_{J}),m\}\), where \(J\) jumps have been detected. Taking the average over different measurement records, we recover the evolution described by the master equation ( 4 ). 

In an ideal setting, each jump in the system trajectory matches a corresponding detection event. However, in any realistic monitoring setup, many jumps might not be detected. Examples comprise prototypical photon emission from cavities with imperfect mirrors [ 2 ,  3 ,  58 ], Ramsey interferometry in maser-like cavity QED [ 59 ,  60 ], realtime monitoring of tunnelling electrons [ 61 ‚Äì 64 ], or circuit QED setups [ 45 ,  65 ]. In such situations, the monitoring scheme needs to be modified to take into account the detection efficiency \(\eta_{k}\) of each process \(L_{k}\). 

As a consequence of informational leakage in the detection, the state of the system conditioned to a given measurement record can no longer be described by a pure state during the stochastic evolution, being instead a mixture modeled by a density matrix \(\sigma_{t}\). The evolution of the state under imperfect monitoring follows a stochastic master equation of the form: 

\[d\sigma_{t}\] =‚àíi[H,œÉt]dt+‚àëk(dt(1‚àíŒ∑k)ùíü[Lk]œÉt (5) +dtŒ∑k‚Ñã[Lk]œÉt+dNkùí•[Œ∑kLk]œÉt),  

where we introduced the supeoperators \(\mathcal{H}[L]\sigma:={\mathsf{T}}[L^{\dagger}L\sigma]\sigma-\{L^{\dagger}L, \sigma\}/2\) and \(\mathcal{J}[L]\sigma:=L\sigma L^{\dagger}/{\mathsf{T}}[L^{\dagger}L\sigma]-\openone\), describing respectively the smooth evolution of the system when no-jumps are detected and the abrupt changes produced by the jumps. Here above the stochastic jumps are incorporated by using Poisson increments \(dN_{k}=\{0,1\}\) associated to the number of detected jumps \(N_{k}\), which verify \(\langle dN_{k}\rangle={\mathsf{T}}[L_{k}^{\dagger}L_{k}\rho_{t}]dt\) and \(dN_{k}dN_{l}=dN_{k}\delta_{k,l}\). 

For perfect detection efficiency, \(\eta_{k}=1\leavevmode\nobreak\ \forall k=1,...,K\), the second term in the first line of Eq. ( 5 ) disappears, and we recover the ideal monitoring case, for which \(\sigma_{t}=\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}_{t}\), and Eq. is equivalent to the stochastic Figure 1. a) Sketch illustrating imperfect detection for a driven two-level atom in an optical cavity. b) Samples of heat dissipated as a function of time conditioned on given set of (two) detected events together with their conditional average \(\langle Q|\gamma_{[0,\tau]}\rangle\)(black thick line) and the standard average \(\langle Q\rangle\)predicted by the Lindblad master equation (grey dashed line).
