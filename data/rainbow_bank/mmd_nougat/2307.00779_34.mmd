and define a robust welfare function as 

\[\mathrm{RW}(d)=\sup_{\gamma\in\Sigma(\delta)}\mathbb{E}_{\gamma} \left[\sum_{\ell=1}^{L}Y_{\ell}I(d(X)=\ell)\right].\]  

Proposition _ For_ \(\ell\in[L]\)_, let_ 

\[c_{\ell}(s_{\ell},s_{\ell}^{\prime})=|y_{\ell}-y_{\ell}^{\prime} |+\|x_{\ell}-x_{\ell}^{\prime}\|_{2}.\]  

_Assume that_ \(Y_{\ell}\)_is unbounded,_ \(\mathbb{E}[\|X\|_{2}^{2}]<\infty\)_and_ \(\mathbb{E}[|Y_{\ell}|]<\infty\)_. Then_ 

\[\mathrm{RW}(d) =\sup_{\lambda\geq 1}\left\{\inf_{\pi\in\Pi(\mu_{1,L+1},\dotsc, \mu_{L,L+1})}\int_{\mathcal{V}}\min_{\ell\in[L]}\{y_{\ell}+\phi_{\lambda,\ell} (x_{1},\dotsc,x_{L})\}d\pi(s)-\langle\lambda,\delta\rangle\right\},\]  

_where_ 

\[\varphi_{\lambda,\ell}(x_{1},\dotsc,x_{L})=\min_{x^{\prime},d(x^{ \prime})=\ell}\sum_{\ell=1}^{L}\lambda_{\ell}\|x_{\ell}-x^{\prime}\|_{2}.\]  

Proposition  7.1  is an extension of Proposition  6.5 . 

## Concluding Remarks 

In this paper, we have introduced W-DMR in marginal problems for both nonoverlapping and overlapping marginals and established fundamental results including strong duality, finiteness of the proposed W-DMR, and existence of an optimizer at each radius. We have also shown continuity of the W-DMR-MP as a function of the radius. Applicability of the proposed W-DMR in marginal problems and established properties is demonstrated via distinct applications when the sample information comes from multiple data sources and only some marginal reference measures are identified. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first systematic study of W-DMR in marginal problems. Many open questions remain including the structure of optimizers of W-DMR for both non-overlapping and overlapping marginals, efficient numerical algorithms, and estimation and inference in each motivating example. Another useful extension is to consider objective functions that are nonlinear in the joint probability measure such as the Value-at-Risk of a linear portfolio of risks in Puccetti and R¨uschendorf ( 2012 ) and robust spectral measures of risk in Ghossoub et al. ( 2023 ) and Ennaji et al. ( 2022 ).
