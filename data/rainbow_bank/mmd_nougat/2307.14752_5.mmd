These expressions are similar to those obtained in the framework of time-dependent approach in [32], where \(\gamma_{0}(\omega)\)was arbitrary pulse shape. However, here the expressions (41) and (42) are valid if the incident photon is a delta pulse (39). For this case, these expressions are exact asymptotic solutions for time dependent scattering of a single-photon pulse from a two-level atom [46]. 

For arbitrary shape of \(\gamma_{0}(\omega)\)the exact expressions (33) and (34) must be used. 

Below we present several plots for qubit’s amplitude, forward and backward photon spectra calculated from expressions (36), (33), and (34) for incident travelling Gaussian pulse: 

\[\gamma_{0}(\omega)=\left({\frac{2}{{\pi\Delta^{2}}}}\right)^{1/4}\exp\left({i( \omega-\omega_{s})t_{0}-\frac{{(\omega-\omega_{s})^{2}}}{{\Delta^{2}}}}\right),\] (43)  

\(\Delta\)is the width of Gaussian pulse in the frequency domain, \(t_{0}=x_{0}/v_{g}\) is the time that it takes for the center of a Gaussian packet to travel from the point \(x_{0}\) to the point \(x=0\)where the qubit is located. 

We assume that at the initial time \(t=0\)qubit is in its ground state and the maximum of the envelope of a Gaussian pulse is located at the distance \(x_{0}\) from the qubit. The plots of qubit’s excitation probability \(|\beta|^{2}\)for three values of initial distance \(x_{0}\) between Gaussian pulse and qubit are shown in Fig. 1 for \(\Delta/\Omega=0.1\)and three values for decay rates \(\gamma=\Gamma/\Omega=0.02,0.04,0.1\). It is clearly seen that the qubit decay rates depend on \(\gamma\): the lower \(\gamma\)the longer the qubit decays. Our calculations (not shown here) show that the maximum excitation, \(|\beta_{max}|^{2}\approx 0.38\), \(\Delta=\Gamma\)no matter how far the pulse is initially from the qubit. Similar result ( \(|\beta_{max}|^{2}=0.4\)) was obtained in [31] where the position of the peak of the pulse at \(t=0\)was at the distance \(10v_{g}/\Gamma\)from the qubit. 

We rewrite (33) and (34) in Wigner-Weisskopf approximation, \(\Gamma(\omega)=\Gamma(\Omega)\equiv\Gamma\), \(g(\omega)=g(\Omega)=(\Gamma/4\pi)^{1/2}\). The frequency shift \(F(\omega)=F(\Omega)\)is incorporated implic\(\Omega\). 

\[\gamma_{WW}(\omega)=\gamma_{0}(\omega)\frac{{\omega-\Omega+i\frac{\Gamma}{4}}} {{\omega-\Omega+i\frac{\Gamma}{2}}}+\frac{{\frac{\Gamma}{{4\pi}}P\int\limits_{ 0}^{\infty}{\frac{{d\omega^{\prime}\gamma_{0}(\omega^{\prime})}}{{\omega- \omega^{\prime}}}}}}{{\omega-\Omega+i\frac{\Gamma}{2}}},\] (44)  

\[\delta_{WW}(\omega)=\gamma_{0}(\omega)\frac{{-i\frac{\Gamma}{4}}}{{\omega- \Omega+i\frac{\Gamma}{2}}}+\frac{{\frac{\Gamma}{{4\pi}}P\int\limits_{0}^{ \infty}{\frac{{d\omega^{\prime}\gamma_{0}(\omega^{\prime})}}{{\omega-\omega^{ \prime}}}}}}{{\omega-\Omega+i\frac{\Gamma}{2}}}.\] (45)  

We compare these expressions with those obtained in [32] for arbitrary pulse shape and with the extension of the coupling to negative frequencies: 

\[\gamma(\omega)=\gamma_{0}(\omega)\frac{{\omega-\Omega}}{{\omega-\Omega+i\frac{ {\Gamma}}{2}}},\] (46)  

\[\delta(\omega)=\gamma_{0}(\omega)\frac{{-i\frac{{\Gamma}}{2}}}{{\omega-\Omega+ i\frac{{\Gamma}}{2}}}.\] (47)  

First, we study how the photon spectra depend on the distance \(x_{0}\) of a Gaussian peak from qubit. This behavior is shown in Fig.2. For relative large distance, \(x_{0}=0.4\)m, the exact equations (44) and (45) provide practically the same result as the approximate equations (46) and (47). As the Gaussian peak becomes closer to the qubit the spectral lines more and more deviates from large distance results. Finally, we obtain the photon spectra for \(x_{0}=0\)as shown in Fig.3. 

Below in Fig.3, Fig.4, Fig.5 and Fig.6 we plot the forward, \(S_{1}(\omega)=|\gamma_{WW}(\omega)|^{2}\Omega\)and backward, \(S_{2}(\omega)=|\delta_{WW}(\omega)|^{2}\Omega\)radiation spectra calculated from exact expressions (44) and (45), and systematically compare ), \(S_{3}(\omega)=|\gamma(\omega)|^{2}\Omega\), ), \(S_{4}(\omega)=|\delta(\omega)|^{2}\Omega\).  If it is not specified explicitly, all spectra are calculated for \(x_{0}=0\). 

The equations (46) and (47) provide the flux conservation at every frequency: \(|\gamma(\omega)|^{2}+|\delta(\omega)|^{2}=|\gamma_{0}(\omega)|^{2}\). However, this simple condition is not valid for exact equations (44) and (45) where the normalization condition has the form of integral quantity (9). For every plot in Fig.3-Fig.6 we calculated the normalizing quantity \(I=\int{d\omega}\left|{\gamma_{WW}(\omega)}\right|^{2}+\int{d\omega}\left|{ \delta_{WW}(\omega)}\right|^{2}\)where the integration was performed within the frequency span of the plots. In every case, \(I\) differs from unity less than a percent. 

The major difference between the plots of equations (44), (45) and those of equations (46), (47) is that the transmittance \(|\gamma_{WW}(\omega)|^{2}\)never equals zero at the resonance frequency, \(\omega=\Omega\)and the reflectance \(|\delta_{WW}(\omega)|^{2}\)never reaches its maximum value \(|\gamma_{0}(\Omega)|^{2}\). These are the principal part integrals in (44), (45) which are responsible for these properties. From the other hand, the shape of the lines are similar. The transmittance \(|\gamma_{WW}(\omega)|^{2}\)is up shifted relative to \(|\gamma(\omega)|^{2}\), while the reflectance \(|\delta_{WW}(\omega)|^{2}\)is down shifted relative to \(|\gamma(\omega)|^{2}\).
