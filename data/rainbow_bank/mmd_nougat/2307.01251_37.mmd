### 5.4. Properties of the probability of violation 

In the following, we briefly present the most important properties of the probability of violation and the notion of typicality of non-locality. 

_Dependence on number of measurement settings.—_ It was shown in Ref. [274] that the probability of violation increases rapidly with the number of measurement settings per party. For the GHZ state, already for two parties and five settings, \(\mathcal{P}_{V}\)\(100\%\). This fact can be explained in two ways. Firstly, from a statistical point of view, as the number of settings increases, so does the chance of finding suitable pairs of settings. Secondly, new inequalities emerge involving all the additional measurement settings. Additionally, in Ref. [260] it is shown in general that for any pure bipartite entangled state, the probability of violation tends to unity when the number of measurement settings tends to infinity. 

_Multiplicativity of probability of violation.—_ The probability of violation is not additive, but rather multiplicative [274], in the sense that the probability \(\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{BL}}=1-\mathcal{P}_{V}\) to choose settings allowing a Bell-local explanation is multiplicative over subsystems with 

\[\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{BL}}(\varrho_{1}\otimes\varrho_{2})=\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{ BL}}(\varrho_{1})\,\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{BL}}(\varrho_{2}).\] (92)  

This immediately hints at the increase of \(\mathcal{P}_{V}\) with system size. Consider for example a product of \(n\) two-qubit GHZ states \({\mathrm{GHZ}_{2}}^{\otimes n}\). Using the result \(\mathcal{P}_{V}\left(\mathrm{GHZ}_{2}\right)=2(\pi-3)\) obtained above, the probability of violation becomes 

\[\mathcal{P}_{V}\left({{\rm GHZ_{2}}^{\otimes n}}\right)=1-\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm {BL}}\left({{\rm GHZ_{2}}^{\otimes n}}\right)=1-\left(\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{BL} }\left({\rm GHZ_{2}}\right)\right)^{n}=1-(7-2\pi)^{n},\] (93)  

which converges to unity for large \(n\). 

_Maximal probability of violation.—_ It was shown that the \(n\)-particle GHZ state maximises the probability of violation for a special set of two-outcome inequalities containing only full \(n\)-particle correlation functions when \(n\) is even [260]. More generally, if we are not restricted to any particular type of inequality and consider the full set of possible twosetting Bell inequalities (in practice only realisable via the numerical method discussed in Sec. 5.3) it turns out that the GHZ states do not exhibit the highest \(\mathcal{P}_{V}\). Note that due to the numerical nature of the considerations, it is di ffi cult to explicitly find the state which maximises \(\mathcal{P}_{V}\). 

_Maximal non-locality and maximal entanglement.—_  One commonly used measure of non-locality, namely the robustness to white noise, was already introduced in Eq. (5.2). However, it has many disadvantages. One flagship example is the discrepancy between the maximal violation of the two-setting \(d\)-outcome CGLMP inequality [277] and its violation by the \(d\times d\) maximally entangled state. It turns out that some asymmetric states tolerate a greater admixture of white noise while remaining non-local than the maximally entangled states. For the probability of violation, however, the value is maximised by the maximally entangled states and the anomaly disappears at least for \(d\leq 10\)[278]. In addition, it is proven in Ref. [260] that for two qubits in a pure state the probability of violation for bipartite fullcorrelation Bell inequalities is an entanglement monotone. 

_Witness for genuine multipartite entanglement.—_ The probability of violation can also serve as a witness of genuine multipartite entanglement [102]. For example, for \(n=3\)and two settings per party, \(\mathcal{P}_{V}>2(\pi-3)\) certifies that the state is truly multipartite entangled [274]. For a larger number of particles and a larger number of settings, similar criteria can also be formulated. However, so far they are only based on numerics, see, e.g. Ref. [279]. 

_Typicality of non-locality.—_ The notion of probability of violation also allows to address the question how typical non-locality is not only under variation of observables but also of states. In Ref. [274], it was shown that the typical \(n\)-qubit states present in many quantum information problems for \(n\geq 5\)exhibit Bell non-local correlations for almost any choice of observables ( \(\mathcal{P}_{V}>99.99\%\)). In Ref. [268], through a sampling of the whole state space of pure states it was demonstrated that for a random pure state the probability of violation strongly increases with the number of qubits and already for \(N\geq 6\)it is greater than \(99.99\%\).
