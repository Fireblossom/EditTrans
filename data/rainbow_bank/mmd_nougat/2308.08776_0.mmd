We then aggregate occupation exposure to the industry level to obtain industry exposure scores. The results indicate a positive correlation between occupation exposure and wage levels/experience premiums, suggesting higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater displacement risks from LLM-powered software. The industry exposure scores align with expert assessments and economic intuitions. We also develop an economic growth model incorporating industry exposure to quantify the productivity-employment trade-off from AI adoption. Overall, this study provides an analytical basis for understanding the labor market impacts of increasingly capable AI systems in China. Key innovations include the occupation-level exposure analysis, industry aggregation approach, and economic modeling incorporating AI adoption and labor market effects. The findings will inform policymakers and businesses on strategies for maximizing the benefits of AI while mitigating adverse disruption risks. 

## Introduction 

The recent remarkable progress in the field of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) ( Bubeck et al. 2023 ; Zhao et al. 2023 ) has provoke many pressing questions about the effects of these powerful technologies on the economy. One of the most significant questions surrounding advances in Generative AI and LLMs is the impact these technologies will have on the dynamics of labor market due to the influence of LLMs on labor inputs. A branch of research emphasizing on the disruptive labor market impacts of LLMs is emerging quickly, however, it predominantly focuses attention on the labor market in developed economy, in particularly U.S. ( Eloundou et al. 2023 ;  Peng et al. 2023 ;  Noy and 

Raj, and Seamans 2023 ). Nevertheless, countries differ in their labor market structures such as occupation and industry 

composition. Even for the same occupation, the detailed task composition or work content may show great discrepancies across countries. Therefore, this paper analyzes the potential impacts of LLMs on China’s labor market. To construct our primary exposure index, we use a recently developed methodology to systematically assess which occupations are most exposed to advances in LLMs in China. Specifically, we employ three large language models – GPT4 ( OpenAI 2023 ), InternLM ( InternLM-Team 2023 ), and GLM ( Zeng et al. 2022 ;  Du et al. 2022 ) – as classifiers to determine the occupational exposure based on the detailed description for each occupation contained in the general code of occupational classification of the People’s Republic of China. We also employ expert annotators to explore the impacts of LLMs, to make comparisons, and to shed more light on this issue. 

We then characterize the profile of occupational exposure to LLMs based on characteristics of the occupation in China. Our analysis indicates that the impacts of LLMs on China’s labor market are likely to be pervasive and diverse. The results show a great heterogeneous exposure across occupations and suggest that more educated, relatively high-paid, white-collar occupations may be most exposed to LLMs. In addition to the positive correlation between wage, education and occupational exposure, we also find a positive correlation between experience premium and exposure to LLMs, implying a potential diminishing return of learning by doing in the future. We analyze exposure by industry and discover that the education and healthcare industries exhibit high exposure, while manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction demonstrate lower exposure. Unlike other developed countries, that young and old cohort distribute highly unevenly across industries in China demonstrate a great variance of demographic exposure of LLMs. Relatively LLMs inevitably exert a higher impact on young age employers. 

Our analysis also indicates that LLMs will have a greater impact on labor demand. We utilize an online job postings dataset from January 2017 to December 2022 in China to construct an occupational vacancies index. We find a positive correlation between the share of vacancies and exposure score at occupation level. This implies that the labor demand structure is likely to exacerbate the disruptive im
