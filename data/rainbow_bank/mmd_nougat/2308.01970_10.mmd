From the above, \((J_{c}+J_{g})\mathbb{V}=\mathbb{0}\) can be re-arranged as 

\[\frac{1}{C_{0}}\left[\frac{1}{\omega^{2}L}-(C_{1}+2C_{2}+C_{3}+2C_{4})\right] \mathbb{V}=-\left(\begin{matrix}-C_{5}&C_{1}+C_{3}&0&C_{2}+C_{4}&0&0\\ C_{1}-C_{3}&-C_{5}&C_{2}-C_{4}&0&0&0\\ 0&C_{2}+C_{4}&-C_{5}&C_{1}+C_{3}&0&C_{2}+C_{4}\\ C_{2}-C_{4}&0&C_{1}-C_{3}&-C_{5}&C_{2}-C_{4}&0\\ 0&0&0&C_{2}+C_{4}&-C_{5}&C_{1}+C_{3}\\ 0&0&C_{2}-C_{4}&0&C_{1}-C_{3}&-C_{5}\end{matrix}\right)\mathbb{V}\] (20)  

or simply \(\bar{p}^{\prime}\mathbb{V}=\bar{P}^{\prime}\mathbb{V}\)\(\bar{p}^{\prime}\mathbb{V}=\bar{P}^{\prime}\mathbb{V}\), where \(\bar{p}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{C_{0}}\left[\frac{1}{\omega^{2}L}-(C_{1}+2C_{2}+C_{3 }+2C_{4})\right]\)\(\bar{p}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{C_{0}}\left[\frac{1}{\omega^{2}L}-(C_{1}+2C_{2}+C_{3 }+2C_{4})\right]\)and  \(\bar{P}^{\prime}\)\(\bar{P}^{\prime}\)is the matrix on the RHS (Eqs. 5 and 6). \(C_{0}=1\)                                       0  Ï‰ L
nF normalizes the capacitances such that the non-EB eigenvalues are very close to \(0\)and \(1\). Numerically, 

\[\bar{P}^{\prime}=\left(\begin{array}[]{cccccc}0.5&-8.85&0&-5.91&0&0\\ -0.25&0.5&0.17&0&0&0\\ 0&-5.91&0.5&-8.85&0&-5.91\\ 0.17&0&-0.25&0.5&0.17&0\\ 0&0&0&-5.91&0.5&-8.85\\ 0&0&0.17&0&-0.25&0.5\\ \end{array}\right)\] (21)  \[\bar{P}^{\prime}=\left(\begin{array}[]{cccccc}0.5&-8.85&0&-5.91&0&0\\ -0.25&0.5&0.17&0&0&0\\ 0&-5.91&0.5&-8.85&0&-5.91\\ 0.17&0&-0.25&0.5&0.17&0\\ 0&0&0&-5.91&0.5&-8.85\\ 0&0&0.17&0&-0.25&0.5\\ \end{array}\right)\] (21)  

which differs very little from the exact  \(\bar{P}\)\(\bar{P}\) given by Eq. 17 above. 

#### Experimental design and procedure 

The experimental circuit is designed using the PADS circuit design software, which assists in selecting the PCB configuration, stackup layout, internal layers and grounding. To prevent unintended interference between different PCB layers, a grounding layer is placed in the gap between any two layers. Moreover, all PCB traces are designed to have a relatively large width (0.5mm) to reduce the parasitic inductance, and the spacings between electronic components are also made sufficient large (1.0mm) to avoid spurious inductive coupling. A relay is used to simultaneously switch on or off the input voltages across all nodes when required. The op-amps used are of the model LT1363, and are powered through the DC power supply UNI-T UTP1306S. 

To ensure accurate experimental implementation of our theoretically designed circuit Laplacian (Eqs. 18, 19), the component uncertainties have to be minimized and their stability optimized. Capacitors of requisite capacitances \(C_{1}=4.55\)nF, \(C_{2}=2.87\)nF, \(C_{3}=4.3\)nF, \(C_{4}=3.04\)nF and \(C_{5}=0.50\)nF with 0.5% error tolerance are obtained by selecting from a large sample of commercially available 3.0nF and 4.7nF capacitors with 10% error tolerance; C0G ceramic capacitors are chosen for their stability. 

The inductors contribute a major source of dissipation that 

can smooth out the desired impedance resonance peaks. To minimize that loss, we select only the inductors with the highest Q values at the operational frequency with impedances \(\Omega\), as measured through a WK6500B impedance analyzer. 

To measure the resonances and hence map out the EB state profiles, an input AC signal is input at an arbitrary node, and a digital storage oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies Infiniivision DSO7104B) measures the voltage signal \(\mathbb{V}\) at each node. The input signal, which is chosen to be at node 2, is generated by an arbitrary waveform generator (ROGOL DG1022Z) with amplitude 2V, with frequency swept from 310kHz to 400kHz to accommodate all expected resonances (  \(\bar{P}^{\prime}\)\(\bar{P}^{\prime}\)eigenvalues). 

To map out the matrix elements of the circuit Laplacian \(J\), the same arbitrary waveform generator is used to successively input a signal with amplitude 2V and frequency 350kHz into each node, one node at a time. For a chosen input node \(i\), the current is \(I_{j}\propto\delta_{ij}\), and the relation \(\mathbb{V}=J^{-1}\mathbb{I}\) allows the \(i\)-th column of \(J^{-1}\)to be read by measuring the resultant voltages \(\mathbb{V}\) on all the nodes. By iterating over \(i\), \(J^{-1}\)can be reconstructed, thereby yielding the Laplacian and its corresponding  \(\bar{P}^{\prime}\)\(\bar{P}^{\prime}\)through matrix inversion. FIG. 5. ** Effect of changing the order** \(2B\)** of the exceptional point.** The \(\bar{p}\)\(\bar{p}\) spectrum of our canonical model \(H_{n=2}\) as the truncation position \(x_{cut}\) is varied. From (a) to (e), we have \(B=1,2,3,4,7\)respectively, all computed with \(L=40\)and \(a_{0}=1\). The values of \(\bar{p}_{\text{EB}}\)\(\bar{p}_{\text{EB}}\) increases exponentially with \(B\), as predicted by Eq. 16, even though they qualitatively unchanged. Saliently, the EB branches increase in a slightly concave manner for all cases (together with their mirror images), which is in good numerical agreement with the theoretical prediction \(\bar{p}_{\text{EB}}\propto 1\pm\sqrt{1+\bar{\lambda}_{\text{EB}}}\sim\left( \frac{L}{\pi}\right)^{B/2}\sqrt{x_{cut}}\)\(\bar{p}_{\text{EB}}\propto 1\pm\sqrt{1+\bar{\lambda}_{\text{EB}}}\sim\left( \frac{L}{\pi}\right)^{B/2}\sqrt{x_{cut}}\), with \(L/\pi=12.73\).
