However, the main reason to make this assumption is technical: if there is no budget constraint, then all individuals would weakly prefer higher levels of rewards. 12 12 This issue is discussed in Patty (2008) in the related context of how legislators might create incentives to maintain party unity. 

We amend the payoff function for individuals given in Equation 2 to accommodate our balanced budget constraint by requiring that each individual pay a tax equal to the average reward that is awarded to individuals, \(r\cdot\overline{d}\). This tax is equivalent to assuming that people receive reward \(r\cdot(1-\overline{d})\) if \(d_{i}=1\), and pay penalty \(-r\cdot\overline{d}\) if \(d_{i}=0\). 

Additionally, we also add a term to the payoff function that allows individuals to have a taste aggregate behavior. Letting \(\pi\) denote the prevalence of compliance in the population, we capture this term by \(t\cdot\pi\), for \(t\geq 0\). Neither this term nor the tax \(r\cdot\overline{d}\) affect an individual’s decision to comply, and so they do not change any of our results thus far. However, these terms do affect preferences over optimal rewards and penalties. 

Incorporating a taste for aggregate compliance into individuals’ payoffs allows us to consider that individuals, as members of a common community, may share preferences over aggregate behavior. The marginal value of the (positive) externality generated by others’ choices to comply ( \(\beta_{j}=1\)) is represented by \(t\geq 0\). As \(t\) increases, all individuals value aggregate compliance more, which can be conceived as an increased negative externality of non-compliance. Residents of a dense urban community may, for example, value safe driving in the aggregate more than residents of a rural community. We will see that as \(t\) increases, all individuals become more supportive of subsidizing compliance. That said, individual tastes for this subsidy also depend on their private costs to compliance. Consequently, even when \(t=0\) every individual will prefer a system of positive rewards and fines. Incorporating these terms into individuals’ payoffs, individual preferences are now described by 

\[r\cdot(d_{i}-\overline{d})-\beta_{i}\cdot\gamma_{i}+t\cdot\pi.\] (8)  

We assume that the structure of the problem is common knowledge to all individuals (including the designer). 13 13 This doesn’t preclude the possibility that individuals have privately observed types, but our analysis also clarifies that, because we require the algorithm designer to use the algorithm to render individual decisions, it is not important whether the designer is aware of any given individuals’ types, because the algorithm is not allowed to condition upon this information. We analyze equilibrium behavior, and the starting point of this analysis is to consider how each individual \(i\) should calculate his or her most-preferred reward level. Each individual will realize that he or she will ultimately choose either to comply or not. Conditional on each of these possible choices, the distribution of types, \(F\), the algorithm, \(\delta\), and individual \(i\)’s type, \(\gamma_{i}\), \(i\) calculates his or her most-preferred reward in each of the two cases. This yields the
