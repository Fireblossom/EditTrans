##### Abstract
Increasing the complexity of a light field through the advanced manipulation of its degrees of freedom (DoF) provides new opportunities for fundamental studies and technologies. Correlating polarization with the light’s spatial or spectral shape results in so-called spatial or spectral vector beams that are fully polarized and have a spatially or spectrally varying polarization structure. Here, we extend the general idea of vector beams by combining both approaches and structuring a novel state of light in three non-separable DoF’s, i.e. space, wavelength, and polarization. We study in detail their complex polarization structure, show that the degree of polarization of the field is only unveiled when the field is narrowly defined in space and wavelength, and demonstrate the analogy to the loss of coherence in non-separable quantum systems. Such light fields allow fundamental studies on the non-separable nature of a classical light field and new technological opportunities, e.g. through applications in imaging or spectroscopy. 

## INTRODUCTION FIG. 1. Conceptual idea. A simple generation scheme consisting only of a birefringent crystal, a quarter wave-plate (QWP), and a vortex-retarder generates a complex light field where polarization, wavelength, and space are correlated. The color in the insets symbolizes the different wavelength components of the light field. ( **A** ) Poincaré sphere displaying that the light field is diagonally polarized. ( **B** ) The Poincaré sphere of the light field shows that each wavelength component has a different linear polarization. ( **C** ) The higher-order Poincaré sphere [ 15 ] illustrates that each wavelength has a different spatial polarization pattern.
