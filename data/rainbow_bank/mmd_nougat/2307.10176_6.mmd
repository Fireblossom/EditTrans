surface of the Bloch sphere. We identified the boundaries of this semiclassically forbidden region through MonteCarlo sampling of semiclassical spin states (i.e., those states constrained to the surface of the Bloch sphere) followed by gradient descent to the lowest possible energy state. We find that entanglement enables the quantum spins to follow trajectories (through the Bloch sphere interior) that bypass this semiclassical energy barrier. This allows the quantum spin network to reach lower-energy steady-state configurations. Slower ramps could allow the semiclassical trajectories to follow a more adiabatic path back downward to similarly low-energy states. However, we find that such ramps must be at least an orderof-magnitude slower than those considered here. 

The steady-state energy of the quantum trajectories seems to be primarily controlled by the ramp rate. Evolution through the superradiance transition has the form of a many-body Landau-Zener problem with many-body gaps controlling the adiabatic timescale of the transition. The many-body gap near the transition is on the order of \(\omega_{z}\) for a ferromagnetic \(J\). Thus, \(\omega_{z}^{-1}\)sets the timescale for adiabatic evolution through the transition to either of the two ferromagnetic ground states. By contrast, spin glasses are characterized by nearly degenerate spin configurations that become exponentially numerous with \(N\). This results in much smaller gaps near the transition and nonadiabatic evolution is more likely to occur, as we see in Fig. 4(b). The chosen ramp rate is slow enough to prevent nonadiabatic transitions to highly excited states, but not enough to prevent transitions to the nearly degenerate local minima states. Unitary evolution through the transition then produces an entangled superposition of low-energy states, as seen in Fig. 2, before projection into a single spin state occurs. The final energy of the trajectories is thus controlled by the nonadiabatic transitions experienced during the ramp as well as the measurement projection before \(\omega_{z}\) is ramped to zero. 

## REPLICA SYMMETRY BREAKING 

We now explore the emergence of RSB as the system is pumped through the transverse Ising transition. To do so, we first analyze the correlations between independent quantum trajectories of a system with the same quenched disorder for all trajectories. That is, a frustrated spin system with the same \(J\) matrix for all trajectory simulations. The replica spin overlap parameter \(q_{\alpha\beta}\) is defined as [3] 

\[q_{\alpha\beta}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\langle\sigma_{i\alpha}^{x}\rangle}{ \langle\sigma_{i\beta}^{x}\rangle}.\] (8)  

Here, \(\sigma_{i\alpha}^{x}\)refers to the Pauli operator for spin index \(i\) and replica \(\alpha\), where each replica corresponds to an independent quantum trajectory for a fixed \(J\) matrix. Once spins align along \(\sigma_{i}^{x}\), the overlap takes on one of \(N+1\)possible values \(\in[-1,1]\). The overlap distribution is always \(0\)due to the global \(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\) symmetry, in the absence of a longitudinal field. An ordered phase will exhibit an overlap distribution containing ‘goal-post’ peaks near \(\pm 1\)due to replica self-overlaps \(q_{\alpha\alpha}\). (Paramagnets do not have such peaks, but ferromagnets and spin glasses do.) Peaks may also arise associated with overlaps \(q_{\alpha\beta}\)FIG. 5. (a-e) Time evolution of the overlap distribution for 200 quantum trajectories corresponding to the \(J\) matrix in Figs. 2–4. Each panel shows the probability for each spin overlap value to occur at each given time during the ramp sequence. Error bars in this figure and in subsequent figures are estimated from bootstrap analysis; see App. F for details. (f-j) Time evolution of the full overlap matrix \(q_{\alpha\beta}\). The time that corresponds to each panel is the same as the panel above. The histograms in (a-e) can be recovered by binning the off-diagonal values in the overlap matrix. Each overlap matrix is ordered via an independent hierarchical clustering of spin states at each time.
