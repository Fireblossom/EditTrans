\(O(10^{-3})\). This suggests that the states with \(S(T)=\tilde{S}\) accessible by VEEF should form a subarea in the Hilbert space. The time evolutions with different \(T\)’s and VEEF’s reach different states in such a subarea. 

We conjecture that the whole subarea with genuinely saturated EE is in principle accessible by the VEEF with any \(T\geq T_{S}\). To verify this conjecture, we take the final state \(|\psi(T^{\prime})\rangle\)as the target state, and optimize the field to optimally prepare an initial product state to \(|\psi(T^{\prime})\rangle\)in the evolution with the total time \(T\). The field is optimized by minimizing the infidelity \(F_{\text{in}}(T;T^{\prime})=1-|\langle\psi(T^{\prime})|\hat{U}(T)|\psi(0)\rangle|\). Taking \(T=4\), \(T^{\prime}=6\) ( \(T<T^{\prime}\)) and \(T=6\), \(T^{\prime}=4\) ( \(T>T^{\prime}\)) as two examples, low infidelity with \(F_{\text{in}}(T;T^{\prime})\sim O(10^{-4})\) between the target and prepared states is obtained, which supports our conjecture. With the VEEF that maximizes \(S(T)\), we cannot specify which state will be obtained in the saturated-EE subarea, since inside the subarea the states have equal \(S\) and thus the gradients of \(S\) against \(h^{\alpha}_{n}(t)\) should be zero. 

The velocity is a universal quantity for different system sizes. Fig.  3  shows the EE \(S(T)\) of the final state against the total evolution time \(T\) on the 1D QIM. For \(T\geq T_{S}=\frac{N}{2v}\), the EE reaches the genuine saturation with \(S(T)=\tilde{S}\) (marked by the vertical and horizontal dot lines). For \(T<T_{S}\), we have \(S(T)=vT\) that is the maximal EE reachable in the evolution time \(T\) under the velocity \(v\). This is consistent with the linear growth of \(S(t)\). We robustly have \(v\simeq 2.76\) for the QIM of different sizes. 

The velocity is relevant to the interaction type. Fig.  4 shows that \(S(T)\) grows linearly with the Ising, XY ( \(\hat{H}_{n,n+1}=\sum_{\alpha=x,y}\hat{S}_{n}^{\alpha}\hat{S}_{n+1}^{\alpha}\)\(\hat{H}_{n,n+1}=\sum_{\alpha=x,y}\hat{S}_{n}^{\alpha}\hat{S}_{n+1}^{\alpha}\)), and Heisenberg ( \(\hat{H}_{n,n+1}=\sum_{\alpha=x,y,z}\hat{S}_{n}^{\alpha}\hat{S}_{n+1}^{\alpha}\)\(\hat{H}_{n,n+1}=\sum_{\alpha=x,y,z}\hat{S}_{n}^{\alpha}\hat{S}_{n+1}^{\alpha}\)) interactions with the velocity \(v=2.76\), \(4.98\), and \(5.75\), respectively. The linear growth can be exceeded with the presence of long-range interactions. We demonstrate this by two random lattices [see the inset of Fig.  4 (b) and (c)], where the probability of coupling each two spins FIG. 2. (Color online) The EE \(S(t)\) against the time \(t\) with different total evolution time \(T\). The inset shows the \(S(t)\) for \(T<T_{S}\), which satisfy the linear relation \(S(t)=2.76t\). 

FIG. 3. (Color online) The EE \(S(T)\) of the final state versus the total evolution time \(T\) for different numbers of spins \(N\). In all cases, the EE grows following the linear relation \(S(T)=2.76T\) for \(T\leq T_{S}\), and converges to the genuine saturation \(\tilde{S}=N/2\)\(\tilde{S}=N/2\). 

FIG. 4. (Color online) The EE \(S(T)\) of the final state versus the total evolution time \(T\) with (a) Ising, (b) XY, and (c) Heisenberg interactions. Linear growth of \(S(T)\) is observed for the 1D spins chains (red squares), with the velocity \(v\simeq 2.76\), \(4.98\), and \(5.75\) for the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg interactions, respectively. For the two lattices with random connections (RC), which are denoted as RC-1 and RC-2 [see the insets of (b) and (c), respectively], the logarithmic growth is demonstrated.
