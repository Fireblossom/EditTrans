shortly) coordination on \(\overline{a}\) whenever \(x>\tilde{x}\), where \(\tilde{x}\in\mathbb{R}\)\(\tilde{x}\in\mathbb{R}\) is the _ critical state_  which she – the planner – chooses. The planner faces two constraints. First, she cannot condition her policy on the realization of \(x\) or players’ signals thereof. One interpretation is that the planner must commit to her policy before Nature draws a true \(x\) and cannot change her policy afterward. 

The second constraint upon the planner’s problem has to do with the kinds of policies she can use. We assume that the planner cannot coordinate players on her preferred equilibrium in a multiple equilibria setting. Instead, she has to rely on simple subsidies (or taxes) to create the appropriate incentives. The focus on simple instruments also means that policies cannot condition directly upon other players’ actions. These are standard assumptions in the literature on policy or contract design for coordination problems (Segal, 2003; Winter, 2004; Bernstein and Winter, 2012; Sakovics and Steiner, 2012; Halac et al., 2020). 

To streamline the narrative, we henceforth focus on subsidies as the planner’s policy instrument. Let \(s_{i}\) denote the subsidy paid to a player \(i\) who chooses \(a_{i}=1\). Conditional on the subsidy \(s_{i}\), player \(i\)’s incentive to choose 1 becomes 

\[u_{i}(a_{-i}\mid x,s_{i})=u_{i}(a_{-i}\mid x)+s_{i}=x+w_{i}(a_{-i})-c_{i}+s_{i},\]  

and the expected incentive, given the signal \(x_{i}^{\varepsilon}\)and a strategy vector \(p_{-i}\), is 

\[\begin{split}u_{i}^{\varepsilon}(p_{-i}\mid x_{i}^{\varepsilon},s_{i})&=\int u _{i}(p_{-i}(x_{-i}^{\varepsilon})\mid x,s_{i})\,\mathrm{d}{F}_{i}^{\varepsilon }(x,x^{\varepsilon}_{-i}\mid x_{i}^{\varepsilon})\\ &=\int\left[u_{i}(p_{-i}(x_{-i}^{\varepsilon})\mid x)+s_{i}\right]\mathrm{d}{F }_{i}^{\varepsilon}(x,x^{\varepsilon}_{-i}\mid x_{i}^{\varepsilon})\\ &=u_{i}^{\varepsilon}(p_{-i}\mid x_{i}^{\varepsilon})+s_{i}.\end{split}\] (4)  

It is clear that a tax equal to \(s_{i}\) on playing 0 has the same effect on incentives. Note that  (4) assumes observability of \(a_{i}\); this assumption is maintained throughout most of the analysis. Section 6.1 considers principal-agent problems in which the vector of actions \(a\) is unobserved.
