impose the UMAS assumption. Reassuringly, estimates show that admission to the case-study program, Business Administration at PUC Santiago, increases students’ probability to graduate from that program. The effect is particularly strong for those whose next-preferred alternative is Economics at UChile or Social Sciences and Humanities at PUC Santiago. 

Admission to our case-study program also strongly decreases students’ probability to reapply through the centralized system in subsequent years for students whose local next-preferred option is Science and Engineering at UChile, Economics at UChile, or Social Sciences and Humanities at PUC Santiago. Interestingly, for students with the latter two next-best alternatives, it also decreases the probability to graduate from any program. For students whose next-best alternative is Science & Engineering at UChile, the naive estimate indicates a small negative effect on graduation from any program while our bounds show that this effect cannot be signed and may be 50 times larger in magnitude. Bounds do suggest that admission to Business Administration at PUC Santiago has a negative effect on reapplication for these students. While we generally see magnitudes of 0.1 or 0.2 in the effects on graduation from Business Administration or any program, we see much smaller magnitudes on the students’ probability to graduate from a STEM program —which is reassuring given that our definition of STEM does not include Business Administration. Finally, we find a strong positive effect on the probability to graduate from a top institution for those whose local next-best alternative is Law or Social Sciences and Humanities at PUC Santiago. 

## Conclusion 

Centralized mechanisms for the assignment of students to educational programs are growing in popularity across the world. These systems provide a valuable source of exogenous variation through discontinuities around admission cutoffs. This along with individual-level data on admissions, preferences, and future outcomes allow researchers to identify a wide range of causal effects of education on outcomes. The variation is useful for identification as long as we control for students’ true preferences; however, true preferences generally differ from what students report to the mechanism given that most implementations of mechanisms generate incentives for students to behave strategically. 

This paper provides a novel approach to partially identify effects from mechanism assignment on future outcomes that is robust to strategic behavior. We illustrate our approach using data from a deferred-acceptance mechanism that assigns roughly 70,000 students to more than 1,000 university-major programs every year in Chile. First, we find substantial evidence of strategic behavior which confirms earlier findings from the literature on Chile. Second, we compute bounds on the average effect of program assignment on graduation outcomes. We do so for students whose scores are marginal to the cutoff of admission into one of the most popular and selective programs in the system: business administration at the Catholic University of Santiago. Although admission into this program increases the likelihood of graduating from that same program, its effect on the likelihood of ever graduating from university varies depending on what students prefer as their
