the requirement of Hermiticity and trace preservation follows that the generator can be rewritten as \(\mathcal{L}_{t}=\mathcal{H}_{t}+\mathcal{D}_{t}\)with a Hamiltonian part ‚Ñãt[.]=‚àíi[KS(t),.]and a dissipator with generalized Lindblad structure 

ùíüt[.]=‚àëkŒ≥k[Lk.Lk‚Ä†‚àí12{Lk‚Ä†Lk,.}] (24)  

with time dependent rate functions \(\{\gamma_{k}(t)\}\) and operators \(L_{k}(t)\).  This decomposition is not unique, i.e. for each time \(t\) the transformation to Lindblad operators and Hamiltonian 

\[L_{k}\longmapsto L_{k} - \alpha_{k}\mathbb{I}_{S}\] (25) \[K_{S}\longmapsto K_{S} + \sum_{k}\frac{\gamma_{k}}{2i}(\alpha_{k}L_{k}^{\dagger}-\alpha_{k }^{\star}L_{k})+\beta\mathbb{I}_{S}\] (26)  

\[L_{k}\longmapsto L_{k} - \alpha_{k}\mathbb{I}_{S}\] (25) \[K_{S}\longmapsto K_{S} + \sum_{k}\frac{\gamma_{k}}{2i}(\alpha_{k}L_{k}^{\dagger}-\alpha_{k }^{\star}L_{k})+\beta\mathbb{I}_{S}\] (26)  

with arbitrary scalar functions \(\{\alpha_{k}(t)\}\) and \(\beta(t)\)leaves the generator invariant [21]. However, an unambiguous choice can be made for \(\mathcal{D}_{t}\) if we demand a minimal dissipator which corresponds to traceless Lindblad operators [30]. 

Once the minimal dissipator is determined the corresponding \(K_{S}\) defines \(H_{S}^{\rm D}\). Note, that the minimization does not fix \(\beta(t)\)but, because it is irrelevant for the dynamics, it can be set to zero. 

The change of internal energy, work and heat is now given by 

\[\Delta U_{S}(t)= \text{Tr}(H_{S}^{\rm D}(t)\,\rho_{S}(t))-\text{Tr}(H_{S}^{\rm D}( 0)\,\rho_{S}(0))\] (27) \[\delta W_{S}(t)=\] Di‚Å¢n‚Å¢t()0tdt‚Ä≤Tr(HÀôSD(t‚Ä≤)œÅS(t‚Ä≤)) (28) \[\delta Q_{S}(t)=\] Di‚Å¢n‚Å¢t()0tdt‚Ä≤Tr(HSD(t‚Ä≤)œÅÀôS(t‚Ä≤)) (29) \[=\] Di‚Å¢n‚Å¢t()0tdt‚Ä≤Tr(HSD(t‚Ä≤)ùíüt[œÅS]).

(30)  

\[\Delta U_{S}(t)= \text{Tr}(H_{S}^{\rm D}(t)\,\rho_{S}(t))-\text{Tr}(H_{S}^{\rm D}( 0)\,\rho_{S}(0))\] (27) \[\delta W_{S}(t)=\] Di‚Å¢n‚Å¢t()0tdt‚Ä≤Tr(HÀôSD(t‚Ä≤)œÅS(t‚Ä≤)) (28) \[\delta Q_{S}(t)=\] Di‚Å¢n‚Å¢t()0tdt‚Ä≤Tr(HSD(t‚Ä≤)œÅÀôS(t‚Ä≤)) (29) \[=\] Di‚Å¢n‚Å¢t()0tdt‚Ä≤Tr(HSD(t‚Ä≤)ùíüt[œÅS]). (30)

(30)  

The advantage of this identification is that it just depends on the system state \(\rho_{S}\) and could, in general, be applied without knowledge about the environment. In addition, it is based on an extremum principle. However, the useful correspondence between minimal dissipator and traceless Lindblad operators is only established for finite Hilbert spaces. This limitation already causes problems if a single field mode is considered as the system. Even though this can be circumvented by appropriate truncation of the Hilbert space if the dynamics are restricted to a finite subspace, it remains a minor short-coming of an otherwise very convincing approach. 

## APPLICATION TO EXAMPLES 

To compare these different approaches we study the implications for a simple model and three types of interaction. A two-level system (TLS) or atom is considered as the system of interest and a mode of the radiation field as its environment. 

This is a standard example in quantum optics and it has been considered in various variations in quantum 

thermodynamics. It is also frequently encountered as an analogue to a steam engine with a working medium (gas, TLS) coupled to a work depository (piston, field mode) [16, 31]. One advantage of this system, and probably the reason for its frequent use as a model, is that it can be treated analytically. Further, semi-classical analogues are available, that can be exploited for a comparison with semi-classical results 

The free Hamiltonian is \(H_{0}=H_{S}+H_{E}\) with \(H_{S}=\omega_{S}\sigma^{\dagger}\)and \(H_{E}=\sigma+\omega_{E}a^{\dagger}a\) where \(\omega_{S}\) and \(\omega_{E}\) denote the frequencies and \(\sigma\) and \(a\) the lowering operators of atom and field, respectively. 

Atom and field are initially uncorrelated, i.e. they are in a product state \(\rho(0)=\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{E}(0)\)with 

\[\rho_{S}(0)=\begin{pmatrix}p_{e}&p_{eg}\\ p_{eg}^{\star}&p_{g}\end{pmatrix}\] (31)  

and the field is in a thermal state, i.e. \(\rho_{E}(0)=(1-e^{-\beta\omega_{E}})e^{-\beta H_{E}}\)where \(\beta=1/k_{B}T\). 

For the minimal dissipation approach we have to determine the master equation for the reduced density matrix and identify the effective Hamiltonian and traceless Lindblad operators with corresponding rates. The procedure for this setup is detailed in Appendix A. 

### Jaynes-Cummings 

At first we consider the interaction Hamiltonian given by the Jaynes-Cummings model: 

\[H_{SE}=g(\sigma a^{\dagger}+\sigma^{\dagger}a)\] (32)  

with interaction parameter \(g\). \(H_{SE}\) does not commute with the free Hamiltonians of atom and field: \([H_{SE},H_{S}]=g\omega_{S}(\sigma a^{\dagger}-\sigma^{\dagger}a)\)and \([H_{SE},H_{E}]=-g\omega_{E}(\sigma a^{\dagger}-\sigma^{\dagger}a)\). 

We obtain the correction Hamiltonian \(H_{S}^{\prime}=g(\sigma\langle a^{\dagger}\rangle+\sigma^{\dagger}\langle a \rangle)=H_{S,b}^{\prime}\)which does not commute with \(H_{S}\) (see Eqs. (6) and (8)). Consequently, the effective atomic Hamiltonian equals the bare Hamiltonian in A: \(H_{S}^{\rm A}=H_{S}\). In this way \(U_{S}\) corresponds to the conventional identification, Eq. (1). The work and heat fluxes are given by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12). Only on resonance we obtain zero net work flux  \(\dot{W}_{S}+\dot{W}_{E}=0\)\(\dot{W}_{S}+\dot{W}_{E}=0\)and heat flux \(\dot{Q}_{S}+\dot{Q}_{E}=0\)\(\dot{Q}_{S}+\dot{Q}_{E}=0\), because then \([H_{SE},H_{S}+H_{E}]=0\). 

In B the correction \(H_{S}^{\prime}\)contributes to the effective local Hamiltonian, provided correlations are built up. In the explored parameter range this results only in a small deviation for the integrated fluxes compared to LEMBAS (compare the lines labelled A and B in Fig. 1, where \(\alpha_{S}=0\)). For large interaction strengths \(g\) and considerable coherence in both, atom and field state, the difference between the quantities increases, because it arises due to \(H_{SE}\) and the development of correlations. 

The identification of work and heat in the decomposition scheme (lines labeled C in Fig. 1) is qualitatively
