can indeed verify that the entanglement wedge for \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) is connected (Fig.  2 ). generic feature whenever \(c_{1},c_{2},r_{1},r_{2}\) satisfy ( 2.8 ). The above argument, based on the **B** ₈₄ task, provides a quantum information theoretic proof of the connected wedge 

## Holographic quantum task with a brane 

picture in the case of pure global AdS ₃ with an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane \(Q\). Namely, we demonstrate that the entanglement wedge for the input regions \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) is disconnected when one of the input signals emanates from the brane \(Q\). A \(Q\) with an inhomogeneous cutoff surface \(\mathcal{Q}\) with the same profile.

where \(G_{N}\) is Newton’s constant of the bulk gravity, \(h\) is the determinant of the induced metric on \(Q\), \(K\) is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, and \(T\) is a tension of the brane. Imposing the Neumann boundary condition on \(Q\),
