## SAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 

Two \(n\)-type RTDs were employed for this research, labeled in what follows as RTD-As and RTD-Sb. Both were prepared via molecular beam epitaxy with pseudomorphically grown ternary emitter prewells. The As-based RTD, used as a reference sample, was grown on a Si \(n\)doped GaAs substrate, including an In _0.15_Ga _0.85_As emitter prewell and a double-barrier QW with thicknesses of 5 and 4 nm, respectively. The QW is sandwiched by two 3.5-nm thick Al _0.6_Ga _0.4_As barriers, and the DBS is surrounded by two 20-nm thick undoped GaAs spacer layers, as displayed in Fig.  1  (a) by the simulated band profile of \(\Gamma\)(solid black line) and L (dashed green line) minimums, and the valence band (VB) maximum (solid red line) [ 24 ]. CB barriers at the \(\Gamma\)minimum with a height of around 0.5 eV are expected in this kind of DBSs. Moreover, the separation between \(\Gamma\)and L minima inside the double barrier QW is \(\Delta E_{\text{$\Gamma$-L}}\approx 0.33\)eV, which prevents electrons from occupying L states. A 300 nm thick high-bandgap Al _0.2_Ga _0.8_As optical window was deposited on top of the heterostructure to avoid optical loss by absorption and guarantee optical access for infrared wavelengths. The details of the RTD-As structure are outlined in Ref. [ 25 ] where it was labeled as ‘S-InGaAs’. 

In turn, RTD-Sb is an Sb-based RTD grown on a Te \(n\)-doped GaSb(100) substrate. Its DBS is composed of an emitter prewell and a double-barrier QW of GaAs _0.15_Sb _0.85_, with thicknesses of 5 and 7 nm, respectively. The QW is surrounded by two 4.5-nm thick AlAs _0.08_Sb _0.92_ barriers and the DBS is enclosed by two 20-nm thick undoped GaSb spacer layers, as represented in Fig.  1  (b) [ 24 ]. Here, CB barriers are higher than those \(\Gamma\)min\(\Gamma\)-L energy separation inside the double-barrier QW is \(\Delta E_{\text{$\Gamma$-L}}\approx 0.10\)eV, which is lower as compared with RTD-As. At the top of the structure a 220 nm thick high-bandgap Al _0.30_Ga _0.70_As _0.03_Sb _0.97_ optical window was deposited, also to reduce optical losses and to favor infrared optical access. The heterostructure layout of RTD-Sb is fully described in Ref. [ 26 ] where it was labeled as ‘RTD 3’. 

Both samples were cooled down to a nominal temperature of \(T=4\)K in an ultra-low vibration cryostat (Attocube AttoDRY1000), associated with a homemade confocal microscope and a SourceMeter (Keithley 2400), to study their transport characteristics and the temporal evolution of the optical response emitted from their QWs at different applied voltages. Two excitation lasers (PicoQuant LDH Series) were employed for the optical excitation: one laser with emission energy \(\hbar\omega=1.70\text{ eV}\)and an optical power density of \(2.29\text{ kW}/\text{cm}^{2}\)to excite RTDAs, and another laser with energy \(\hbar\omega=1.15\text{ eV}\)and an optical power density of \(12.5\text{ kW}/\text{cm}^{2}\), used to excite RTD-Sb. Both lasers were operated in continuous-wave and pulsed modes to characterize the emission spectra 

and the temporal evolution via photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectroscopies, respectively. During PL measurements, the optical responses of RTD-As and RTD-Sb observed at different bias voltages were dispersed by a 75 and 50 cm spectrometer (Andor Shamrock), respectively. Then, the signals were detected by a high-speed Si charge-coupled device (Andor iDus 420) and a high-resolution InGaAs diode array (Andor DU491A) for RTD-As and RTD-Sb, respectively. During time-resolved PL measurements, both lasers operated \(80\text{ MHz}\), with a pulse duration \(100\text{ ps}\), while the transient responses were detected by an infrared photomultiplier tube (PicoQuant Si PMT Hybrid and Hamamatsu InGaAs/InP H10330B-75, for RTD-As and RTD-Sb measurements, respectively) coupled to a time-correlated single-photon counting electronics (PicoQuant PicoHarp300).
