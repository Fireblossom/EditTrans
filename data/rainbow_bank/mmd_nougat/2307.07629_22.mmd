We will illustrate an application of Theorem 2 to Example 1 by showing that the optimal experiment choice function is strongly \(c\)-monotone and then discussing how to construct an outcome-equivalent results-based contract. 

**Example 1.**  (Continued.) 

With two types, strong \(c\)-monotonicity reduces to a simple condition \(S_{2}\subseteq U_{1}\). As shown in the Figure 3, the vertices of the thick-lined triangle represent posteriors in \(S_{1}=\{p_{1},p_{1}^{\prime},p_{1}^{\prime\prime}\}\) for the less efficient type \(\theta_{1}\); the vertices of the dashed-lined triangle are posteriors in \(S_{2}=\{p_{2},p_{2}^{\prime},p_{2}^{\prime\prime}\}\) for the more efficient type \(\theta_{2}\). The light grey area represents set \(D_{1}\); the dark grey area represents set \(U_{1}\). We find \(S_{2}\subseteq U_{1}\).
