##### Abstract
We report an algorithm, based on quantum optics formulation, where a coherent state is used as the elementary quantum resource for the image representation. We provide an architecture with constituent optical elements in linear order with respect to the image resolution. The obtained phase-distributed multimode coherent state is fed into an image retrieval scheme and we identify the appropriate laser intensity parameter for similarity measurement. The use of the principle of quantum superposition in the similarity measurement protocol enables us to encode multiple input images. We demonstrate the viability of the protocol through an objective quality assessment of images by adding consecutive layers of noises. The results are in good agreement with the expected outcome. The image distortion-sensitivity analysis of the metric establishes the further merit of the model. Our quantum algorithm has wider applicability also in supervised machine learning tasks. 

## INTRODUCTION 

Quantum mechanics offers a huge improvement in the domains of information processing, computation, and technology by demystifying many physical phenomena, which rely on its peculiar properties, such as the superposition of quantons, and quantum correlations. The applications also subsume quantum sensing [1–4], quantum simulation [5], quantum communication [6–8], quantum imaging [9] and quantum machine learning [10–13]. Quantum algorithms are of utmost importance for various tasks, where Shor’s factorization algorithm, Grover’s search algorithm, Boson sampling, _ etc_  are structured by exploiting quantum computation and also offer computational speedup [14–16]. Various platforms have been explored for implementing the algorithms [17–21], among which a quantum optics-based quantum computer considers light as a quantum state for information carrier and exploits the spooky properties of quantum mechanics [19, 22]. Integrated photonic quantum chips with single photon as information carrier is implemented [23, 24] to perform various computational, information communication, and processing tasks [25, 26]. On the other hand, the use of another state of light, called a coherent state, is an established candidate for several quantum information means, including quantum teleportation [27, 28], quantum key distribution [29], quantum fingerprinting [30–32] and models for universal quantum computer [33, 34]. 

In this work, we introduce a quantum optical-based algorithm, where a harmonic oscillator coherent state, being an appropriate model for a laser, is taken as the resource state, \(\{|n\rangle\}\): 

\[\ket{\alpha}=e^{\frac{-|\alpha|^{2}}{2}}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^{n}}{ \sqrt{n!}}\ket{n}.\]  

Here, \(\alpha\in\mathbb{C}\) is a complex coherent state parameter, connected to the average photon number of the laser. 

Motivated from the fact that, digital image processing is an emerging real-world field, we prepare our algorithm to perform a quantum image processing (QIP) task. When the resolution of the acquired images is gradually increasing with time, imparting greater control over the decision-making and the information acquisition, it necessitate higher storage [35]. Quantum-based hardware is the future solution, which uses quantum correlations and superposition to minimize storage and to maximize computational power. Such integration of storage and processing of images with quantum computation is dealt with by the QIP, which has numerous applications towards edge detector [36–40], image similarity measurement [41–43], image matching [44–46], watermarking [47] _etc_ . Various models for QIP also exist [48], some of those also comprise of qubit lattice, flexible representation of the quantum image (FRQI) and novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR) [49–52]. We also emphasize that our protocol is _ deterministic_ , comprising of deterministic gate operations and measurements. This also makes it quite handy for digital image processing algorithms, where the input and the output are nothing but images. While the image retrieval scheme from the output quantum states is challenging [52], we overcome it by using a single resource state, unlike the qubit-based models, where a large number of interconnected qubits are usually necessary. The underlying quantum image representation model exploits point transformation, global intensity transformations and similarity measurement metric weighted by a cosine nonlinear function. 

In the next section, we discuss the structure of our algorithm for representing digital image via a multimode coherent state where the architecture is based on linear optical elements. Section III provides the method of image retrieval and the identification of appropriate coherent state amplitude for optimal retrieval scheme, relying on indistinguishability and quantum uncertainty. The similarity measurement algorithm between a single test image and an image database is described in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the demonstration of our similarity measurement algorithm for objective quality assessment of images and their distortion-sensitivity, which is fol
