but they have decreased, easing the cost pressure to sell inventories, and prices are lower than their long-run values with expectations of converging back. So stock accumulation gradually increases with lower interest rates. Since the stock accumulation is slow in our example, prices converge to their long-run values from below without overshooting, but overshooting is possible. After 4 years, prices have converged to their long-run values, so the only driver of stock increase is the convergence of interest rate to its long-run average. 

Stock levels present a different sensitivity to storage costs and demand elasticity. Stocks decrease more with an increase in interest rate when storage costs are lower, because for lower physical storage costs, stock levels are higher on average and more sensitive to variation in the opportunity costs. Stocks decrease less for a more inelastic demand. This is explained by the fact that with a more inelastic demand, a small increase of sales from inventory depresses prices much more, limiting the incentives to sell too much from the stocks. 

The right panels of Figure  5  displays the IRFs for price volatility, namely, the conditionally expected standard deviation of price. 22 22 Mathematically, the price volatility  is defined here as the square root of the conditional variance: It shows that price volatility mostly follows stock ùîºt‚àí1[f‚àó(Xt,Zt)]2‚àí[ùîºt‚àí1f‚àó(Xt,Zt)]2. dynamics with a peak attained after a year and an incomplete convergence after 4 years. A larger response in storage generates an oppositely larger response in price volatility. These results match the empirical results of  Gruber and Vigfusson  ( 2018 ) who show that higher interest rates imply higher price volatility.
