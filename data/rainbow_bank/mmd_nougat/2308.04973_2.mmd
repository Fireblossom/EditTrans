# INTRODUCTION 

In response to the 2022 cost-of-living crisis in Europe, the German government introduced a threemonth fuel excise tax cut and a public transport season ticket for 9 Euro per month, valid on all local and regional services, the so-called “9-Euro-Ticket”. The latter can be considered almost fare-free public transport. The selected months were June, July, and August, i.e., a period characterized by summer holidays. Given the critical role of travel costs in mode choice ( _1_ ), this natural experiment was expected to lead to a modal shift to public transport because the season ticket price cut was so substantial. In addition, many expected that the almost fare-free aspect of the “9-EuroTicket” leads to high levels of induced demand. The success of the “9-Euro-Ticket” prompted an immediate discussion as well as public and political demand for introducing a successor ticket to the “9-Euro-Ticket” as soon as possible. This ticket, the so-called “Deutschlandticket”, was finally introduced in May 2023. We set up the “Mobilität.Leben” study to observe this fare policy innovation using questionnaires and GPS tracking to generate travel diaries ( _2_ _,_ _ 3_ ). 

This behavioral intervention, which could be one of the largest public transport pricing travel behavior experiments, has been studied by many: all of them reported a substantial increase in public transport usage during the validity period of the “9-Euro-Ticket” and a return to almost pre-ticket levels after the “9-Euro-Ticket” validity period ( _2_ _,_ _ 4_ _–_ _7_ ). The official and main study was conducted by Association of German Transport Companies, which surveyed more than 200,000 people in Germany ( _4_ ): around 20% of all “9-Euro-Ticket” customers were new customers to public transport. Out of all public transport trips in the months of June, July, and August 2022, 17% of trips have been shifted from other transport modes, and 10% of trips have been shifted from the car to public transport, in rural areas, even 13 to 16%. 16% of all trips correspond to induced demand. In addition, trip distances increased by 38% during the “9-Euro-Ticket” period. Another survey showed that 11% of all trips conducted during the “9-Euro-Ticket” period shifted from other modes of transport, while 6% of all trips were induced ( _6_ ). Using surveys and GPS tracking, another study concluded that the “9-Euro-Ticket” did not lead to a change in daily mobility but instead increased leisure travel at the beginning and the end of the ticket’s validity period, leaving monetary savings as the main effect of the “9-Euro-Ticket” ( _5_ ). Generally, the summer months of June, July, and August usually see less ridership due to the summer holidays, but in 2022 this trend was reversed ( _7_ ). For the “Deutschlandticket”, first results for the Hamburg metropolitan area suggest that season-ticket ownership increased by 22 % and ridership increased from 89.3 % to 95.4 % of the pre-pandemic levels from April to May 2023 ( _8_ ). 

The dominant methodological approach was a cross-sectional survey with online questionnaires and interviews ( _4_ _,_ _ 6_ _,_ _ 7_ ), and panel studies ( _9_ _,_ _ 10_ ). Both are established survey techniques in transport research, also for nationwide household travel surveys ( _11_ _–_ _14_ ). The complexity of the fare-policy innovation with the “9-Euro-Ticket” and the “Deutschlandticket”, however, means that travel behavior changes can result, which are difficult to observe using traditional paper-based or CATI-bases travel diary surveys. For example, one can expect that self-assessments of how individuals travel across transit district zones and district borders can only be answered reliably by individuals with some knowledge of the fare system, not everyone. Here, using GPS tracking can be considered an appropriate supplement or substitute to questionnaires to measure travel behavior and its changes over a long time period. Such tracking-based survey approaches generally work in creating travel diaries ( _15_ ), and it is beneficial in correcting under- or false reporting in traditional approaches ( _16_ _–_ _18_ ). GPS tracking can be done using either GPS loggers, where users can edit or validate entries later on a web browser, or smartphone-based, where users can edit and
