## Introduction 

Measuring income inequality has been a challenging task, as each of the indices used for the purpose attempt to condense the complexities of populations into just one number. Among the many indices, we have the Atkinson, Bonferroni, Gini, Palma, Pietra, Theil, and Zenga indices, to name just a few associated with the names of their inventors. Many treatises have been written on the topic, such as the handbook by  Atkinson and Bourguignon  ( 2000 , 2015 ), which also contains many references to earlier studies, and they are voluminous. 

The indices are often the areas under certain income-equality curves, which are considerably more difficult to present and explain to the general audience, let alone to easily compare. \(1\)minus twice the area under the Lorenz curve. (We shall give mathematical definitions later in this paper.) The curves and thus the indices are based on comparing the mean income of the poor with other means, such as the mean income of the entire population, the mean income of the nonpoor, and the mean income of the rich, whatever the definitions of “poor” and “rich” might be. Hence, to be well defined, the curves and the indices inevitably assume that the mean of the underlying population is finite. With the rising income inequality, and thus with the distribution of incomes becoming more skewed and heavily tailed, researchers have therefore sought other ways for measuring inequality. 

Gastwirth  ( 2014 ) proposed to use the median instead of the mean when “normalizing” the absolute Gini mean difference, widely known as the GMD. The author noted, however, that the proposed index might fall outside the class of normalized indices because it compares the _ mean_  income of the poor with the _ median_  income of the entire population. There is a natural remedy to this normalization issue: compare the _ median_  income of the poor with the _ median_  of the population. Even more, we can compare the median income of the poor with the median of the “not poor” or, for example, with the median of the rich, whatever the latter might mean. This is the path that we take in this paper to arrive at the indices to be formally introduced in the next section. 

In this regard we wish to mention the study of  Bennett and Zitikis  ( 2015 ) where it is shown that a number of classical indices of income inequality arise naturally from a Harsanyi-inspired model of choice under risk, with persons acting as _ reference-dependent_ expected-utility maximizers in the face of an income quantile lottery, thus giving rise to a reinterpretation of the classical indices as measures of the desirability of redistribution in society. This relativistic approach to constructing indices of income inequality was further explored by  Greselin and Zitikis  ( 2018 ), although more from the modeller’s perspective than
