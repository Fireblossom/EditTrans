tocol that implements the imaginary time evolution tra

jectory without any need for quantum tomography or ancilla resources. This hybrid algorithm involves a classical time integration to generate the adiabatic Hamiltonian. When implemented faithfully, the algorithm leads to an exponential decrease of the infidelity with the groundstate of a desired Hamiltonian with adiabatic time. However, the cost of evolving exactly to long imaginary times grows rapidly with imaginary time both in the classical and quantum parts of the protocol. The growth in cost as a function of imaginary time arises from several sources, including the nonlocality of the derived adiabatic Hamiltonian. This nonlocality can be controlled by suitable heuristics which truncate terms in the adiabatic Hamiltonian. Another source of growing cost at long imaginary time is related to the norm of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its gap, for which modifications of the generating equation of the adiabatic Hamiltonian can be introduced and which should be further explored. However, because of the rapid decrease of the infidelity it is possible to propagate for short times and to observe a large improvement in the approximate ground-state. More generally, the A-QITE adiabatic path introduced in this work can be considered as extending the space of possible adiabatic paths; this potentially allows for introduction of new quantum adiabatic routines consisting of composite adiabatic paths (with A-QITE as one of them), with applications such as introduction of novel adiabatic catalysts [8, 24], etc. This is a direction to be explored in the future. 

Overall, a significant advantage of the current approach is that it can be implemented with a minimal amount of quantum resources (i.e. no ancillae and no measurement-based feedback). This makes our procedure a good match for near-term quantum architectures.
