_To conclude this section, notice that the main cost of our approach is that we are not able to_ _identify as many group-time average treatment effects as would be possible using other identifi-_ _cation strategies. For example,_ ** –“color [RGB]–0** ** 0˝callaway-karami-2023˝** _ suppose that_ _the researcher has access to a time-invariant covariate that does not affect the path of untreated_ _potential outcomes and show that this sort of covariate can be used to generate additional moment_ _conditions to identify the parameters in the model for untreated potential outcomes. Our approach_ _does not require this sort of covariate (which is a key advantage of our approach), but it comes at_ _the cost of only being able to identify_ _ ATT_ _ without recovering_ $ATT(3,3)$_ ATT_ _ which_ $ATT(3,4)$eas $ATT(4,4)$he approach in – ** –“color [RGB]–0** ** 0˝callaway-karami-2023˝**
