mechanism [30]. The PLE linewidth is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the expected lifetime limit. The observed broadening could be due to homogeneous factors that would affect a single center on the timescale of our measurements including phonon-broadening, spectral diffusion and hyperfine interactions. It could also be due to inhomogeneous factors such as static microscopic electric and strain fields and isotope disorder. 

While significantly broader than the lifetime limit, the PLE ensemble linewidth is still remarkably narrow and is less than 100 times the lifetime limit. In comparison, the best ratio of inhomogeneous:radiative linewidths for _ in-situ_  doped nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers is 1000 [31]; this ratio is even larger for REIs [22]. This narrow linewidth persists in transmission measurements. Fig. 1d shows the optical depth (OD) \(\alpha d\)through the \(d=300\) µ m substrate, where \(\alpha\)is the frequency-dependent absorption constant. The In D 0 X absorption linewidth through the 300  µ m-thick sample is only 10 % broader than the micro-PLE linewidth, suggesting that high optical homogeneity persists over large volumes. The Al and Ga D 0 X transmission measurements saturate at 11.5 OD. This saturation occurs when the resonant PL intensity from the sample exceeds the transmitted laser power. Assuming that the linewidth does not significantly vary between micro-PLE and transmission measurements, a fit to the wings of the transmission spectra give a peak OD of 25 for Ga and more than 300 for Al. High optical depth with such low residual doping densities is possible due to the large D 0 X oscillator strength. 

The area under each OD peak is proportional to the number of donors in the probed ensemble, and thus can be used to estimate the average donor density. The donor density of donor \(N_{x}\)( \(x\)= Al, Ga, In) can be estimated from [32] 

\[N_{x}=8\pi\frac{g_{D\textsuperscript{0}}}{g_{D\textsuperscript{0}X}}\left( \frac{n}{\lambda_{x}}\right)^{2}\tau_{x,\mathrm{rad}}\int\alpha(\nu)d\nu,\] (1)  

where \(g_{i}\)is the degeneracy of state \(i\), \(n\)is the index of refraction, \(\lambda_{x}\)is the vacuum transition wavelength, \(\tau_{x,\mathrm{rad}}\) is the zero-phonon-line radiative lifetime. We estimate the ZPL radiative lifetime as the total radiative lifetime determined by the slow decay component of the experimental lifetime, divided by the fraction of emission into the ZPL. This fraction is determined by the Huang-Rhys parameter [20] and the ratio of the two-electron satellite transitions to the phononassisted transitions. We obtain \(\tau_{x,rad}=0.95\) ns, 1.18 ns, and 1.52 ns for \(x=\) Al, Ga, and , we find \(N_{\rm Al}=7.5\cdot 10^{15}\rm\,cm^{-3}\), \(N_{\rm Ga}=9.9\cdot 10^{14}\rm\,cm^{-3}\), and \(N_{\rm In}=7.4\cdot 10^{13}\rm\,cm^{-3}\). These values, measured for Sample A, are within an order of magnitude of the SIMS values measured for sample B. The relative concentrations are consistent with the PL spectra for this sample (App. C). 

An optical depth \(\alpha d\gg 1\) is a critical requirement for the development of efficient optical quantum memories [2]. Warm atomic vapors [33] and cold atoms [34] can achieve optical depths from the tens up to a thousand in cm-scale devices. These high optical depths are more challenging to achieve in solid-state systems which typically have much lower oscillator strengths [22,23] and large inhomogeneous broadening. In comparison, the ZnO donor-bound exciton system combines high oscillator strength, high homogeneity, and optical depth at residual donor densities. 

### Temperature dependence 

Defect-phonon interactions can be a dominant optical dephasing mechanism. Defect-phonon interactions are typically considered a homogeneous broadening mechanism due to the fast timescale. Fig. 2 depicts the PLE linewidth dependence of the D 0 \(\leftrightarrow\)D 0 X transition for temperatures varying from 1.5 to 18 K for all three _ in-situ_  doped donors in sample A. Implanted In (sample B) at low implantation doses follows a similar dependence, however a stronger temperature dependence is observed at higher doses (App. D).
