that the long-range property of the measurement, controlled by \(\gamma\), gives an essential effect on the dynamics, especially on the steady states. It leads to the conclusion that stronglyentangled steady states emerge solely by two-body measurements with sufficient long-range properties. Late time dynamics of the negativity also supports this physical picture as shown in Fig.  2 (b). That is, the saturation values of the negativity increase as enhancing the long-range measurement by decreasing \(|\gamma|\), and quantum entanglement gets stronger as approaching the all-to-all case, while for short-range measurement, such correlation is suppressed. We further note that in relaxation process in early-time periods the negativity exhibits a sudden increase, implying that the quantum correlation is generated there. 

Next, we observe system-size dependence of the saturation values. The saturation values are taken at \(t_{N}=20\) where the system sufficiently reaches a steady state. The calculations of the TMI and half-cut entanglement entropy \(S_{AB}\) are shown in Fig.  3 . We find that both data exhibit volume-law scaling such as \(S_{AB}\propto L\) and \(-\tilde{I}_{3}\propto L\) for small negative \(\gamma\) and all-toall case, while for large negative \(\gamma\) a kind of subvolume-law scaling appears. This implies existence of an entanglement phase transition induced by varying production probability of the long-range measurement. We also observe the systemsize dependence of the saturation value of the negativity, the results of which are shown in Appendix B. The long-range properties of measurement significantly influence on entanglement of steady states. 

### Steady state as varying long-range parameter in LR3BM 

Similar calculation to the case of the LR2BM is carried out for the LR3BM to investigate the dynamical behavior of the TMI. The \(\gamma\)-dependent results of the TMI is shown in Fig.  4 (a). For small negative \(\gamma\) (the long-range property is enhanced), the TMI has large negative values. Even for large negative \(\gamma\)â€™s (the long-range property is suppressed), it re

mains negative. This indicates that the long-range property of the measurement generates strong correlations to the dynamics, especially on steady states. Contrary to the R2BM case, even in short-range regime, the correlation remains, implying a volume-law phase survives in the short-range regime. This is consistent to the observation in Ref. [ 27 ]. 

As for the negativity, its values under the time evolution keep zero, indicating that the three-body measurement cannot create Bell-pair-like entanglement between \(A\) and \(B\) subsystems. 

We next observe system-size dependence of saturation values of the TMI and half-cut entanglement entropy \(S_{AB}\). The saturation value is taken at \(t_{N}=10\), at which the states reach a steady state. The results are shown in Figs.  4 (b) and (c). We find the volume-law scaling \(S_{AB}\propto L\) and \(-\tilde{I}_{3}\propto L\)for almost the entire range of \(\gamma\) up to the all-to-all case. For large negative \(\gamma\) (short-range measurement), the volume law is weak, and we cannot judge whether it is subvolume law or volume law. We discuss this point later on. 

### Phase transition in LR2BM 

In the previous subsection, we observed that the long-range property of the projective measurement induces the volumelow phase in the LR2BM for small negative \(\gamma\), whereas for large negative \(\gamma\) (short-range), the subvolume law emerges instead. Hence, we expect that there is a phase transition between the above two regimes. To verify this expectation, we FIG. 3.

We averaged over \(\mathcal{O}(10^{2})-\mathcal{O}(10^{3})\) samples for each system size \(L\).
