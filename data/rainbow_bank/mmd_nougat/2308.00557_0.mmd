##### The local oscillator in practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution system fluctuates
The local oscillator in practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution system fluctuates at any time during the key distribution process, which may open security loopholes for the eavesdropper to hide her eavesdropping behaviors. Based on this, we investigate a more stealthy quantum attack where the eavesdroppers simulates random fluctuations of local oscillator intensity in a practical discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system. Theoretical simulations show that both communicating parties will misestimate channel parameters and overestimate the secret key rate due to the modified attack model, even though they have monitored the mean local oscillator intensity and shot-noise as commonly used. Specifically, the eavesdropper’s manipulation of random fluctuations in LO intensity disturbs the parameter estimation in realistic discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system, where the experimental parameters are always used for constraints of the semidefinite program modeling. The modified attack introduced by random fluctuations of local oscillator can only be eliminated by monitoring the local oscillator intensity in real time which places a higher demand on the accuracy of monitoring technology. Moreover, similar quantum hacking will also occur in practical local local oscillator system by manipulating the random fluctuations in pilot intensity, which shows the strong adaptability and the important role of the proposed attack. 

## INTRODUCTION 

Quantum key distribution (QKD) [ 1 ] relies on quantum mechanical properties to ensure communication security, which allows two remote parties to generate unconditionally secure keys despite the presence of potential eavesdroppers in quantum channels [ 2 ,  3 ]. Depending on the dimension of coding, it can be divided into discretevariable QKD (DV-QKD) and continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) [ 4 ,  5 ]. Between them, CV-QKD uses coherent detection technology to replace single-photon detection technology, which can be well compatible with classical optical communication systems [ 6 ]. In addition, the transmission distance achieved recently can support the requirement in metropolitan distances [ 7 – 9 ] which facilitates the large-scale application of QKD [ 10 **? ?**  – 14 ]. 

CV-QKD based on Gaussian-modulation (GM) [ 15 – 25 ] is widely used, where the quadratures of quantum states are modulated according to the Gaussian probability distribution. Moreover, discrete-modulated (DM) CV-QKD [ 26 ], where the quadratures of quantum states are modulated discretely, has also been gaining a lot of attention. Due to the simplicity of state preparation [ 9 ,  27 ,  28 ] and lower complexity of classical error correction [ 29 ,  30 ], the unconditional security of DM CVQKD protocols (e.g.two-state and three-state protocols [ 31 ,  32 ]) has been successively proved. Recently, one of its security analysis theory is using the semidefinite program (SDP) model to give the lower bound of the secret key rate [ 33 – 37 ], and related experiments have also been carried out [ 9 ,  29 ,  38 ]. With the tremendous progress in 

theory and experiment of DM CV-QKD in recent years, its practical system security has received increasing attention. Different from theoretical analysis, the transmission of the local oscillator in the practical DM CV-QKD system would leave Eve with vulnerabilities to perform quantum hacking. 

The local oscillator (LO) is required for stable coherent detection, whose non-ideality within practical environments is usually ignored in the security analysis of CV-QKD. Due to the imperfection of practical blocks and devices, researchers have proposed many quantum hacking models aiming at practical LO, such as local oscillator calibration attack [ 39 ], local oscillator intensity fluctuation attack [ 40 ], wavelength attacks [ 41 ,  42 ], polarization attack [ 43 ] and so on. Particularly, the transmission of LO opens a security vulnerability which gives eavesdropper (Eve) advantages to exploit the fluctuation of LO intensity [ 44 ]. We note that in the previous studies [ 40 ], Eve is assumed to reduce the intensity of LO overall using variable attenuators which can easily be defended by commonly-used monitoring technology such as monitoring the LO intensity mean and optical power or monitoring the shot-noise. In other words, the above manipulation and monitoring of LO intensity is carried out on its overall mean. When Eve simulates random fluctuations in LO intensity with invariant mean value, a more serious security loophole appears because above mentioned monitoring techniques will fail. 

In this paper, we propose a modified local oscillator intensity attack (LOIA) with random fluctuations. Eve can exploit the random fluctuating properties of LO intensity to launch a more stealthy attack by attenuating a part of LO pulses while amplifying another part of LO pulses.
