defined as 

\[C_{a}\left(\rho_{AB}\right)=\textrm{max}\sum_{i}p_{j}\,C\left(|\phi_{j}\rangle _{AB}\langle\phi_{j}|\right),\] (15)  where the maximization is done over all possible combinations of 

\(\rho_{AB}=\sum_{j}p_{j}|\phi_{j}\rangle_{AB}\langle\phi_{j}|\)into the pure states \(|\phi_{j}\rangle_{AB}\) such that \(\sum_{j}p_{j}=1\)and \(p_{j}\geqslant 0\). An explicit formula has been derived in Ref. [42] for \((2\otimes 2\otimes n)\)-dimensional pure states, this is 

\[C_{a}\left(\rho_{AB}\right)=F\left(\rho_{AB},\tilde{\rho}_{AB}\right)=\sum_{j} \sqrt{\lambda_{j}},\] (16)  

where \(\tilde{\rho}_{AB}\)\(\tilde{\rho}_{AB}\) and \(\lambda_{j}\) were defined in the previous subsection. Here, \(F\left(\rho,\sigma\right)=\left[\textrm{tr}\left(\rho^{1/2}\sigma\rho^{1/2} \right)^{1/2}\right]^{2}\)is the fidelity [83]. The \(CoA\) is a monotone function but it cannot be considered a genuine entanglement measure [84]. 

A new measure that describes the genuine tripartite entanglement of the pure state \(|\psi\rangle_{ABC}\) was introduced by _ Chang-shui et al_  from the idea that there is a trade-off between the CoA and the concurrence [43], it is given by 

\[\tau\left(\rho_{ABC}\right)=\sqrt{C_{a}^{2}\left(\rho_{AB}\right)-C^{2}\left( \rho_{AB}\right)}.\] (17)  

It is clear that \(\tau\left(\rho_{ABC}\right)\geqslant 0\)is in agreement with the definitions in Eqs. (13) and (16). Note also that \(\tau^{2}\left(\rho_{ABC}\right)\)could make us think that this inequality violates the monogamy of entanglement [30] where the entanglement shared between the different subsystems is limited, however, the property remains. It can be better understood by re-writing Eq. (17) as 

\[C_{a}^{2}\left(\rho_{AB}\right)=C^{2}\left(\rho_{AB}\right)+\tau^{2}\left(\rho _{ABC}\right).\] (18)  

Here, the \(CoA\) has two contributions, the \(AB\)-entanglement and the \(ABC\)-entanglement. While subsystem \(C\) increases the entanglement between \(A\) and \(B\), the remaining entanglement \(\tau^{2}\)decreases. In other words, the \(AB\)-state is maximally entangled when it completely disentangles from \(C\). 

Therefore, the \(\tau\)-measure vanishes if any bipartition from the tripartite system is separable, _ i.e._ 

\[|\psi\rangle_{ABC}=|\psi\rangle_{ij}\otimes|\psi\rangle_{k},\] (19)  

with \(\{i,j,k\}=\{A,B,C\}\;\left(i\neq j\neq k\right)\)and where \(|\psi\rangle_{ij}\) represents the bipartite pure state partially or maximally entangled and \(|\psi\rangle_{k}\) is the uncorrelated subsystem. This quantity is
