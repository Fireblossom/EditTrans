## Methodology 

### Data Overview 

The Features of the data which has been provided below 


1. Date (DD/MM/YYYY)
2. Max.Demand met during the day (MW)
3. Shortage during maximum Demand (MW)
4. Energy Met (MU)
5. Drawal Schedule (MU)
6. OD(+)/UD(-) (MU)
7. Max OD (MW)
8. Energy Shortage (MU)

Energy Shortage (MU) feature is not available every day. This feature is recorded from 2017-05-09 as per the reports generated by the PSP by POSOCO. The data is available here [ 0 ]. This paper focuses on Univariant Analysis not to make it as complex, but to consider Max Demand met during the day (MW) as a single column. 

As the column "Max Demand met During the day" is the major feature that we consider. The data starts from 2013-04-01 to 2023-05-31 which consists of 3713 days but the data points only consist of 3640 with the missing data we use the Imputation Techniques dataset and Non-Imputation Techniques dataset (no_null). 

For Imputation Techniques, this paper considers Mean, Median, Mode, and Linear Interpolation Imputation data that has been imputed. So, as combined this generates 5 datasets where the models are applied to compare the performance of which Imputation is good. 

Table 1 depicts the datasets which are created from the univariant data taken from one of the features in the dataset. ("Max. Demand met during the day (MW) "). As explained in the Methodology section the dataset is divided into train and test to take the MAPE score. For ARIMA models we generate train MAPE and test MAPE to check the overfitting criteria also with AIC, BIC, log(p), etc... 

## Forecasting Models 

This paper develops a Time series forecasting model ARIMA which is known to be an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average. the models which include AR, MA and ARMA, and ARIMA, and develop a model list from these regression types using the parameters. The major parameters included in the arima model are p, q, and d where p is the parameter for Auto-regressive co-efficient which says about how many days have the co-relation between today’s date. 

The real-world data tends to be always non-Stationary. A signal is said to be stationary if its statistical properties like mean, standard deviation, trend, etc... doesn’t change over time. To check if the time series is stationary or not, we use \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
1 & dropna-dataset \\

2 & mean Imputation dataset \\

3 & median Imputation dataset \\
\hline
4 & mode Imputation dataset \\
\hline
5 & linear-Interpolation Imputation dataset \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
