due to this more efficient representation of the wave function amplitudes. 

The virtual orbital spatial extent has been used previously 103,104 to estimate the ability of locally correlated spaces to describe the diffuse regions of electron density that are important for response properties. Fig. 11 shows the virtual MO energy \(\epsilon_{a}\) and the PNO occupation number \(n_{a}\) plotted against the orbital extent \(\langle r^{2}\rangle\)in a.u. In the PNO basis, a unique virtual space is prepared for every occupied pair, resulting in 10 unique spaces for the four occupied spatial orbitals \(i\). However, for transforming a single orbital index, we only require the diagonal rotation matrices, _ i.e._ , \(Q_{ii}\). There are four such spaces; however, by symmetry, only two are unique, and both are included in Fig. 11. 

Truncation of the PNO space begins from the bottom of Fig. 11, e.g. at an occupation number cutoff of \(1\times 10^{-9}\)(indicated by a horizontal line), all orbitals below this line are neglected in the PNO space. This results in the PNO space with a \(T_{2}\) ratio of 0.69. From these data, it is clear that even modest truncation of the virtual space neglects the diffuse regions of the wave function, which are important for excited-state properties in systems with significantly delocalized characteristics, such as systems containing Rydberg-type excitations. 

The same analysis can be performed for the PNO++ virtual spaces in Fig. 12. The 

horizontal line indicates a cutoff of \(1\times 10^{-8}\), corresponding to a \(T_{2}\) ratio of 0.74. Below Figure 10: PNO++-basis \(\lambda_{1}\) amplitude deviations from \(t=0\)after (a) 50 a.u. and (b) 100 a.u. of time propagation. Each row contains the same four occupied orbital indices and a subset of virtual indices as indicated by the x-axis labels.
