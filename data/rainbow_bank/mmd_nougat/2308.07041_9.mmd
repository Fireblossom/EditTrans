aged collateral, exogenous/decentrally managed collateral, and endogenous/decentrally managed collateral, we observe consistent results across the five sensitivity factors. The primary difference we observed was in the initial deviations of the price, which were smaller or larger depending on the sensitivity factor. However, crucially, the price and demand of these types were able to recover over time. For stablecoin types with endogenous/centrally managed collateral, we observe similar results for positive demand shocks. However, for negative demand shocks, we observed that this type only experiences a crash if the magnitude of the demand shock is sufficiently large; i.e., for sensitivity factors of 
0.5 and 0.75, this type was able to recover without crashing36 . Conversely, for sensitivity factors of 1.25 and 1.5, we observed a crash, which intuitively occurred more rapidly with a higher magnitude of the demand shock. 
* 2] _ Volatility of demand_ : Across all stablecoin types, we consistently observe the same outcomes across the five sensitivity factors. While there is increased volatility in both demand and price, the overall findings and conclusions remain unchanged. 
* 3] _ Fees_ : For stablecoin types with exogenous/centrally managed collateral, variations in fees did not have a significant effect on either the demand or the price. However, for stablecoin types with exogenous/decentrally managed collateral or endogenous/decentrally managed collateral, adjusting the fees led to changes in both the demand and subsequent price. Additionally, for stablecoin types with endogenous/centrally managed collateral, changes in fees can even result in a crash, independent of any external shocks. 
* 4] _ Price of collateral_ : For stablecoin types with exogenous/decentrally managed collateral, endogenous/decentrally managed collateral, and endogenous/centrally managed collateral, we observe a strong dependence of the stablecoin price on the price of the collateral. In our simulation, stablecoin types with exogenous/centrally managed collateral are directly backed by fiat money, which restricts our ability to analyze shocks in the collateral’s price. This limitation arises because fiat money serves as both the collateral and the reference currency in the model. However, if we were to adjust the model similarly to the other stablecoin types, we would expect to obtain comparable results. 

These sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our results, emphasizing the instability of endogenous/centrally managed stablecoins and the significance of collateral and fees in stablecoin dynamics. 

### Bank runs— 

— A bank run is where a large number of depositors withdraw their deposits from a bank because they fear that the bank may not have enough money to meet their withdrawal requests. Bank runs are often triggered by rumors or fears of a bank’s insolvency or bankruptcy. As depositors withdraw their money, other depositors start to panic and also withdraw their funds, leading to a decline in the bank’s reserves. In extreme cases, bank runs can result in the bank being unable to meet its obligations. During a bank run, the bank may be forced to sell its assets at a loss, which can lead to a chain reaction of other banks being affected and a disruption of the monetary system, causing a reduction in production 37 . 

In a centralized managed collateral system, a single entity—such as a central bank or a smart contract—controls the monetary system. As a result, depositors must rely on this entity’s ability to maintain the system’s stability and solvency. If the entity fails to do so, depositors may lose confidence in the system, triggering a bank run. In contrast, systems with decentral managed
