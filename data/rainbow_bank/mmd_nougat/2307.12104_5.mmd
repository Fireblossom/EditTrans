information disclosure and whether hidden equal-sharing or public winner-take-all contests result in a higher probability of breakthrough for the principal, not on whether the outcome is necessarily socially efficient. Instead, this paper focuses on payoff characterizations that result in social efficiency, rather than maximizing total effort, which was the principal’s objective in Halac et al. (2017). 

This paper is also related to the literature on efficient dynamic mechanism design. This literature primarily focuses on the social choice setting. Bergemann & V¨alim¨aki (2002) study the incentives for agents to acquire information about their own types in a static social choice setting, and Bergemann & V¨alim¨aki (2010) formulates a dynamic pivot mechanism. More relatedly, Athey & Segal (2013) propose a VCG-like mechanism for social choice in a dynamic environment that is also budget-balanced. This paper differs from these other papers in that these other papers require an assumption of private values, which fails when there are explicit payoff externalities resulting from experimentation. Although the Athey & Segal (2013) model can capture informational externalities via the evolution of the belief stochastic process, the payoff externalities in this paper fail the assumption of private values because they introduce interdependence in the instantaneous incentives. 

Indeed, in the presence of payoff interdependence, Jehiel & Moldovanu (2001) show that even in a static setting, efficiency may not attain. In such environments, Mezzetti (2004) shows that requiring transfers after uncertainty resolution can restore efficiency. However, those insights do not apply to the dynamic experimentation setting; because experimentation stops with positive probability, there are outcomes where the state of the world never fully realizes to the agents. 

## Game Structure 

I first formally lay out the baseline structure of the research game. 

**Exposition** There are \(N\) agents \(i\in\{1,2,\dots N\}\) investigating a potential research breakthrough. The research idea is good or bad, which is drawn by Nature prior to the start of the game and unobserved by the agents. Formally, the quality of the research idea is the state of the world, \(\omega\in\Omega:=\{\textnormal{good},\textnormal{bad}\}\). Nature draws the state of the world to be good with probability \(p(0)\), which is the initial prior belief shared by the agents on the state of the world. Time is continuous, \(t\in[0,\infty)\), and at every instant of time, each agent is endowed with a unit measure of a resource (effort) that it allocates over two projects, the status quo
