taxi market. 

The t-test in Table 11 and Table 12 show a significant higher unanticipated transitory wage for both yellow and green taxis than their base year. The relationship between TNC trips and unanticipated transitory wage variation can be seen in Figure 7. The results indicate that drivers are facing more uncertainty in earning opportunities and clearly illustrate the change of drivers’ labor supply behavior over time due to the increasing number of TNC trips. Therefore, we reject 

number of TNC trips. Based on the results, we observe that yellow taxi drivers face much more serious competition than green taxi drivers before 2017. Moreover, such competition leads to an unsustainable state in the ride-sharing market and results in 20% yellow taxi drivers having RDP behavior at the end of 2017, which means a high proportion of taxi drivers lose confidence in the taxi industry. Finally, yellow taxi drivers quit the taxi market. Besides, the green taxi market benefits from the increase in demand at the beginning of TNCs’ growth. Meanwhile, green taxi drivers present NS behavior before July 2017. However, the unanticipated transitory wage variation of green taxi drivers is found to increase after June 2017 and account for over 20% of the total wage variation in both experiments at the end of 2018, which is over three times as compared to when the taxi market is still monopolistic. Consequently, the RDP behavior should not be ignored, and NS behavior is no longer suitable to interpret the total taxi drivers’ work behavior in a competitive \(20\%\)of green taxi drivers perform in a loss-aversion manner in the market rather than the revenue-maximizing behavior, which is widely used when the taxi market is still monopolistic. This finding is aligned with the second explanation for the question that we raised to the OLS model. That is, the driver has a specific reference target. Moreover, the fact that individual labor supply is found to be barely unaffected (see Figure 8) while their monthly income is found to be significantly decreased can be explained by the co-existence of NS and the RDP behavior in the market. Furthermore, combining the examinations of the second and third hypotheses, we conclude that drivers decrease their income target and some of them even quit the market, so that the remaining drivers are observed to still serve the same amount of work hours.
