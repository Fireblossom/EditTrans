and therefore an unbiased estimator of the outstanding claims is the difference between the estimated total and the currently paid amount, 

\[\hat{L}^{O}(\tau)=\hat{L}(\tau)-L^{P}(\tau)=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{Y_{j }}{\pi_{j}(\tau)}-\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}Y_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{ 1-\pi_{j}(\tau)}{\pi_{j}(\tau)}Y_{j}.\] (3)  \[\hat{L}^{O}(\tau)=\hat{L}(\tau)-L^{P}(\tau)=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{Y_{j }}{\pi_{j}(\tau)}-\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}Y_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{ 1-\pi_{j}(\tau)}{\pi_{j}(\tau)}Y_{j}.\] (3)  

The intuition behind the HT estimator lies in the fact that only a portion of all payments \(Y_{j}\) is reported, proportionally to \(\pi_{j}(\tau)\), and so each payment in the sample is “augmented” by a factor of \(1/\pi_{j}(\tau)\)to approximate the actual total amount. It is important to note that the HT estimator is non-parametric, meaning that it leads to an estimation of the reserve that does not require any assumptions on the underlying distribution of the number of claims (frequency) or the distribution of claim sizes (severity), which is a remarkable property. Additionally, we emphasize the fact that even though the estimator is based on the population level (i.e a macro-level scale), the inclusion probabilities are dependent on the individual attributes of policyholders, claims, and payments. Therefore the estimator incorporates granular information as part of the estimation. 

The HT estimator is widely recognized as one of the most influential estimators in the statistics literature, having been extensively studied for over 70 years in the field of population sampling (e.g Arnab (2017)). Consequently, the HT estimator has a solid theoretical foundation and possesses numerous desirable properties that directly inherit to the claim-reserving problem, including consistency, unbiasedness, sufficiency, among others. More recently, it has also been applied in inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods for estimation in causal inference (Yao et al. (2021)), including applications in fairness in insurance. The terminology “IPW estimator” is more extended in and outside the statistics literature, and so We will mostly refer to the estimator of the reserve as the IPW estimator, and reserve the naming of HT estimator when referring to the general concept. 

A specific case of interest arises when we set \(Y_{i}=1\). In this scenario, all the sums above simplifies to a count of the number of payments, allowing us to obtain an unbiased estimator for the number of payments yet to make, as 

\[\hat{N}^{O}(\tau):=\hat{N}(\tau)-N^{P}(\tau)=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{1}{ \pi_{j}(\tau)}-\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}1=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{1-\pi_{ j}(\tau)}{\pi_{j}(\tau)}.\] (4)  \[\hat{N}^{O}(\tau):=\hat{N}(\tau)-N^{P}(\tau)=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{1}{ \pi_{j}(\tau)}-\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}1=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}\frac{1-\pi_{ j}(\tau)}{\pi_{j}(\tau)}.\] (4)  

It is worth noting that this particular expression coincides with the one utilized by Fung et al. (2022) for the specific case of the number of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. In their work, they derived this expression under the assumption that the number of unreported claims follows a geometric distribution and demonstrated its unbiasedness when the number of claims is driven by a Poisson process. However, it is important to emphasize that within the framework of the HT estimator, this result is immediate and does not require of the assumption of the geometric distributions. 

#### A “Micro-level” Chain-Ladder method 

From an actuarial standpoint, the IPW estimator for the ultimate can be perceived as an individuallevel adaptation of the Chain-Ladder method. By expressing the estimator in Equation (2) as \[\hat{L}(\tau)=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}f_{j}(\tau)Y_{j},\]  \[\hat{L}(\tau)=\sum_{j=1}^{N^{P}(\tau)}f_{j}(\tau)Y_{j},\]
