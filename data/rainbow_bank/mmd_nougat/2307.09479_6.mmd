summation of column (4) on the shorted objects in stage one. Thereafter, the objects will be arranged in ascending order concerning price from highest to lowest. And finally, we got the first ranked object as A. We may have got more than one object for the subsequent positions. As we have got only one object here so, the next places will be calculated using the same way by eliminating object A. The secondranked object will be B. And the third object will be F. Here it has been assumed that the customer has a fixed attention span i.e. 3. Hence, we have compared the expected revenue by comparing with another collusive ranking i.e. A-D-F. The article has proved in Proposition 1,2,&3 that the purchase probability for product F in the second list will be more than the actual one. i.e. A-B-F. But this will not guarantee that the expected revenue will be maximum. Because the price of product D may be lower than product B because the demand is lower for product D compared to B. This has been proved in the article and especially in Proposition 1, 2, and 3. Figure 1: Product Rank of Food Items-Example from amazon.in
