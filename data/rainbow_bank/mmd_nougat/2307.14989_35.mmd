proved to be an efficient method for decoding small distance, \(d\in\{3,5,7\}\), rotated planar codes achieving similar performance as the MWPM decoder while maintaining a similar complexity. As a result of the interesting performance of this decoder, several studies discussing ML decoders for the rotated planar code have been proposed such as the deep neural network based decoder in 

2020b ) or the reinforcement learning based decoder in ( Sweke _ et al._ ,  2020 ). The deep neural network decoder proved a better threshold than MWPM at the cost of a higher complexity, while the reinforcement learning decoder proved an almost linear complexity at the cost of a worse code threshold ( Varsamopoulos _ et al._ ,  2020b ). Combinations of NN decoders with RG decoders have also been proposed ( Varsamopoulos _ et al._ ,  2020a ). Machine learning based decoding methods have also been proposed for other topological codes such as the toric code ( Andreasson _ et al._ ,  2019 ;  Domingo Colomer _ et al._ , 

and Melko ,  2017 ;  Wagner _ et al._ ,  2020 ), the color code ( Baireuther _ et al._ ,  2019 ) or the semionic code ( Varona and Martin-Delgado ,  2020 ). Each of the proposed ML decoders for each of the codes provide either a faster decoding or a better threshold than other methods, showing the natural trade-off between accuracy and speed. 

Circuit level noise has also been considered for neural network decoders, i.e. faulty syndrome data arising from noisy gates and measurements ( Baireuther _ et al._ , 

agh ,  2018 ;  Varsamopoulos _ et al._ ,  2017 ). In a similar fashion as other decoders, dealing with noisy measurements requires approximately \(d\)syndrome measurement rounds, implying that the runtime of the decoders increases. Importantly, NN decoder should be trained using this error model so that they can cope with it, i.e. training is specific to the noise model in consideration ( Varsamopoulos _et al._ ,  2017 ). The performance of the NN decoder of ( Varsamopoulos _ et al._ ,  2017 ) achieves the same performance as MWPM for this scenario. 

To sum up, NN decoders are promising in the quest of obtaining accurate and fast decoders for decoding not only rotated planar codes but also other families of error correcting codes. Some of the problematic behind this family of decoders is the training cost, which may scale exponentially with the code distance ( Vasmer _ et al._ ,  2021 ). This is one of the main reasons behind the fact that most of the NN-based decoders have only been tested for small distances \(d<10\)_et al._ ,  2022 ). Interestingly, promising results have been obtained for decoding the toric code with an NN+UF decoder that achieves high threshold with almost linear complexity, while having been tested up to \(d=255\)( Meinerz _ et al._ ,  2022 ). However, the need of a training stage before operation implies that NN and ML decoders might not be the best choice when the noise fluctuates over time, as it occurs for superconducting qubit platforms ( Etxezarreta Martinez _ et al._ ,  2021 ;  Etxezarreta Martinez _ et al._ ,  2023 ). Additionally, it is important to state that mapping the decoding problem to a ML classification problem works well for the rotated planar code or other topological codes since they encode a low number of logical qubits, implying that the possible logical errors is not too high. However, since the number of logical errors scales as \(2^{2k}\)with the number of logical qubits ( Fuentes _et al._ ,  2022 ), \(k\), these methods may not be implementable for other families of codes with higher coding rates such as QLDPC codes. 

#### 4. MaxSAT decoder 

The MaxSAT decoder has been recently proposed as an efficient algorithm to decode color codes ( Berent _ et al._ , 2023a ). This decoder is based on the analogy between the decoding problem of the color code and the LightsOut puzzle when the error model in consideration is the bit-flip noise. The LightsOut puzzle refers to a problem where a lattice whose faces are associated with switches and lights can be either on or off. In such lattice, toggling a switch on the lattice implies that all its neighbouring lights change their previous state, i.e. if they were on they are turned of and vice versa. The LightsOut problem then tries to find out a sequence of switch actions so that all lights are turned off. The puzzle has two important properties: toggling a switch twice is the same as not doing anything and the state of a light only depends on how often its neighbour switch have been toggled (independence on the order). The authors argue that this problem is similar to the decoding process of a color code by doing the following analogy: 


*  Data qubits \(\leftrightarrow\)switches. 
*  Checks \(\leftrightarrow\)lights. 
*  Syndrome \(\leftrightarrow\)initial light configuration. 
*  Decoding estimate \(\leftrightarrow\)switch set that is a solution. 
*  Minimum-weight decoding estimate \(\leftrightarrow\)solution with minimum switch operations. 

Therefore, the authors exploit such an analogy to propose a decoding methods based on solving the LightsOut puzzle. The main idea is to find the minimal solution set for the puzzle, which is equivalent to a decoding estimate of minimum weight matching the syndrome measurement. In order to obtain the minimal solution of the LightsOut puzzle, the authors formulate such problem as a maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem, which generally refers to the problem of determining the maximum number of clauses of a Boolean function that can be made
