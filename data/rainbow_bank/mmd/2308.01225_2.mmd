each root subgroup may be expressed in terms of commutators of other root subgroups. If some commutative unital ring \(K\) acts on the root subgroups in a natural way, then the resulting odd form ring
 \((R,\Delta)\)is an augmented odd form
 \(K\)-algebra and in the last claim of the theorem the maps of the root subgroups are isomorphisms. 

The Chevalley commutator formula is \[[G_{\alpha},G_{\beta}]\leq\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}i\alpha+j\beta\in\Phi\\ i,j\in\{1,2,\ldots\}\end{subarray}}G_{i\alpha+j\beta},\]  we also assume that \(G_{2\alpha}\leq G_{\alpha}\)is
 \(2\)-step nilpotent filtrations for any ultrashort
 root \(\alpha\). In other words, \(G\) is a group with \(\mathsf{BC}_{\ell}\)-commutator relations in the sense of [8]. Alternatively, we may assume only that \(G\) contains groups indexed by a root system of type \(\mathsf{B}_{\ell}\)and \[[G_{\alpha},G_{\beta}]\leq\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}i\alpha+j\beta\in\Phi\\ i,j\in\mathbb{R}_{+}\end{subarray}}G_{i\alpha+j\beta}.\]  These formulas turn out to be equivalent (modulo other natural conditions) up to a choice of the nilpotent filtrations \(G_{2\alpha}\leq G_{\alpha}\). 

\(2\)we recall the definitions of
 \(3\)and
 \(4\)we list the
 precise conditions on \(G\) and its subgroups. Namely, the conditions are (C1)–(C5) without using a commutative unital ring \(K\) or (C1)–(C8) involving \(K\). In section \(4\)we also discuss the case
 \(\ell=3\): under additional “associativity conditions”
 (A1)–(A4) the main results still hold, otherwise there are counterexamples (e.g. Chevalley groups of types \(\mathsf{E}_{6}\) and \(\mathsf{E}_{7}\)). These associativity conditions always hold for \(\ell\geq 4\)by theorem 1. Sections
 \(5\)and
 \(6\)contain the proof of the main theorem
 \(7\)we prove theorem 3 for
 groups satisfying only (C1)–(C5). 

## Odd form groups and odd form rings 

\(2\)-step nilpotent groups with various operations,
 so it is useful to develop some technique to simplify such constructions. The \(2\)-step nilpotent groups is usually denoted by
 \(\dotplus\). All lemmas in this section may be checked directly or using the machinery of polyquadratic maps [14,  § 1.3]. 

We say that
 \((M,H)\)is a
 _ hermitian group_  if \(M\) and \(H\) are abelian groups, there is an automorphism \(\par\!\;\overline{\!\!\:(-)\vphantom{!}\!\!\:}\;\!\colon H\to H\)such
 \(2\), and there is a biadditive pairing
 \(\langle{-},{=}\rangle\colon M\times M\to H\)\(\par\!\;\overline{\!\!\:\langle m,m^{\prime}\rangle\vphantom{!}\!\!\:}\;\!\par =\langle m^{\prime},m\rangle\) such that \(\par\!\;\overline{\!\!\:\langle m,m^{\prime}\rangle\vphantom{!}\!\!\:}\;\!\par =\langle m^{\prime},m\rangle\)for all \(m,m^{\prime}\in M\).
