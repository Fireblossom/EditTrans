The integral over \(y\) can be calculated in terms of the complete elliptical integral of the first kind \(K(x)\) using the identity (3.131.5) from [20] 



taking \(\Omega\rightarrow\Omega+\imath 0^{+}\), where we add infinitesimally small imaginary part as it is required in the retarded Green’s function. Then \(a=(\Omega+\imath 0^{+})^{2}+...\) gets small imaginary part \(2\imath\Omega 0^{+}\)defining the value of \(\operatorname{csgn}\). Taking the limit of infinitisimal \(0^{+}\)we arrive at the following expression for the trace of the Green’s function 

\[\int_{u_{2}}^{u_{3}}\frac{dy}{\sqrt{(u_{3}-y)(y-u_{2})(y-u_{1})}}\] \[=\frac{2}{\sqrt{u_{3}-u_{1}}}K\left[\sqrt{\frac{(u_{3}-u_{2})}{(u _{3}-u_{1})}}\right],\] (16)  

\[\text{Tr}\mathbf{G}(\Omega)=\frac{2\Omega}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}dk_{y}\begin{ cases}\frac{\operatorname{sgn}{a}}{\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}}&\text{for}\;\;a^{2}>b^{ 2},\\ \imath\frac{\operatorname{sgn}{\Omega}}{\sqrt{b^{2}-a^{2}}}&\text{for}\;\;a^{2 }\leqslant b^{2},\end{cases}\] (13)
