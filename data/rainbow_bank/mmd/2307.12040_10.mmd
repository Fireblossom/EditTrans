## Data Availability The original data analysed in this work are part of the Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program 1282 (PI: Th. Henning) with number 66 and will become public on 2 August 2023 on the MAST database ( https://mast.stsci.edu ). The portion of the spectrum presented in Fig.  3  is available on Zenodo at  https://zenodo.org/record/7991022 . The spectroscopic data for water can be downloaded from the HITRAN database ( https://hitran.org ). The Spitzer-IRS spectrum plotted in Fig.  1  is part of the Spitzer-IRS GTO program 40679 (PI: G. Rieke). The spectrum was extracted and calibrated using private codes 56 , 64 and is available on Zenodo at  https://zenodo.org/record/7991022 . The optical constants of the dust species considered in the fitting procedure for the dust continuum can be downloaded from the HJPDOC database ( https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/HJPDOC ). 

## Code Availability The slab model used in this work is a private code developed by B.T. and collaborators. It can be obtained from B.T. upon request. The synthetic spectra presented in this work can be reproduced using the slabspec code, which can be found at  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4037306 . The fitting procedure for the dust continuum uses the publicly available MultiNest Bayesian fitting algo rithm ( https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest ) and the PyMultiNest package ( https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest ). Figures were made with Mat plotlib version 3.5.1. under the Matplotlib license at  https://matplotlib.org/ .
