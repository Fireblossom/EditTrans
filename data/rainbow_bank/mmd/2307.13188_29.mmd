the geometry of these regions is identical to the Einstein-Rosen bridge in a two-sided BTZ geometry with the same mass as the corresponding operator. We will take the interpretation that the details of what appears outside the domain of dependence of \(\mathcal{W}\)of
  is part of the \(\mathcal{W}\)definition of the operator associated to that region. So in sum, the action of the Lorentzian
 cap is 

\[I_{\text{cap}}=\frac{1}{4\pi G_{\textrm{\tiny N}}}V_{\mathcal{W}}+\sum_{i= \text{BH}}I_{i}=\frac{\pi}{4G_{\textrm{\tiny N}}}\sum_{i}\left(\text{Re}(\eta_ {i})-\frac{1}{3}\right)+\sum_{i=\text{BH}}I_{i}\,.\  

Hence we see that it is the sum of three contributions that each depend only on one of the three operators. Thus, we can absorb the corresponding phase generated by the action of the Lorentzian geometry into the definition of the operators, and we will arrive at a real result for the three-point function. 

Hence we arrive at the total action for the single-sided geometry, 

\[I_{\text{single-sided}}=\frac{1}{2}I_{\text{wormhole}}+i\sum_{i}f(i)\,.\  

Again, it is a nontrivial result that the imaginary term is given by the sum shown above since this allows us to absorb the corresponding phases into the definition of the operators. After eliminating these phases, we recover the three-point function from the single-sided bulk geometry, _ i.e.,_ 

\[e^{-I}\approx G_{L}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3})\,,\  

where \(G_{L}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3})\)is the semiclassical Liouville three-point correlator in
 .
 

# Discussion 

In this paper we discussed three-dimensional asymptotically AdS ₃ geometries that are sourced by the insertion of boundary operators whose scaling dimensions is heavy as the central charge of the holographic CFT ₂. The presence of any such operators deforms the AdS geometry by inducing a non vanishing expectation value for the holographic stress tensor, close to the boundary. This is true perturbatively in general dimensions, but in three-dimensions there is an exact solution, due to Ba˜ nados [ 4 ], that describes such deformation. However, this metric does not describe the full bulk spacetime. When only two black hole operators are inserted, we showed that the full geometry is simply an infinite covering of the Euclidean BTZ black hole [ 1 ], but when three or more operators are inserted, we found that the completion of the Ba˜ nados metric into the bulk is a wormhole geometry involving multiple asymptotic boundaries. To understand this rather non trivial fact we rephrased the construction of the bulk geometry as a quotient of AdS ₃ realized by domes and doors. The dome construction is a well know characterization of hyperbolic geometries with an asymptotically AdS ₃ metric, and more familiar from the study of black hole thermodynamics, see _ e.g.,_ [ 38 ], but the addition of the doors is new as far as we can tell. 

As in the description of a Euclidean two-point function geometry in section  2 , _ i.e.,_  as empty AdS ₃ with identifications, the doors are needed to describe the insertion of boundary
