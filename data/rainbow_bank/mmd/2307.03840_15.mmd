## Empirical data 

We observe the changes of activity over time of the empirical networks for the four data sets (Figure 11). The _ US school_  presents periodic patterns, varying from low contact periods when the students are in class to high contact periods when there is a recreational time. The _ US flight_  and _ Conference_ networks have circadian patterns as there are respectively less flights and less contacts at night. Finally, the _ Resistance game_  does not present any periodic change in its activity as every player of the game is looking at someone else at each time step.

**Figure 11:**  Number of events as a function of time for the four data sets: the _ US school_  (panel a), the _US flight_  (panel b), the _ Conference_  (panel c) and the _ Resistance game_  (panel d). The _ US school_  network contains high activity periods during recreational moments of the students’ day, while the _ US flight_  and the _ Conference_  networks present circadian patterns. The Resistance game network does not have particular periodic activity changes.
