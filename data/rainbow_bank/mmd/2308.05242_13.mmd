### Comparative Analysis of Smaller Dataset (65 Images) and Larger Dataset (2700 Images) using Principal Component Analysis We conducted an experiment using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for image reconstruction with both smaller (65 images) and larger (2700 images) datasets, utilizing 50 principal components for representation. The explained variance for the smaller dataset was approximately \(98.19\%\), while for the larger one it was roughly \(98.35\%\) (Figure 18). 

However, visual inspections revealed a marked degradation in quality between the two datasets(Figure 18). In the 65 image dataset, the reconstructions showed anomalies like purplish lines in the background and bluish color distortions. For the 2700-image dataset, the performance was even worse, with greenish horizontal lines appearing in the foreground and failure in capturing essential details. Several factors may contribute to this unexpected result. The increased complexity and variability within the larger dataset might have overwhelmed PCA’s ability to represent finer details. Since PCA relies on linear assumptions, it might have failed to handle the nonlinear structures and dependencies that become more pronounced with the increase in data complexity. The \(1.5\%-2\%\) unexplained variance might contain critical information affecting the visual quality, especially in a larger, more intricate dataset. Moreover, the choice of 50 components might have been insufficient for capturing nuanced variations in the larger dataset, despite sufficing for the smaller one. These observations highlight PCA’s limitations in handling highly complex image data and emphasize that capturing a high percentage of variance does not guarantee accurate or visually pleasing reconstruction.
