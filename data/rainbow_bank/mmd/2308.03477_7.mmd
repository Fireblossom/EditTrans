but consistent with a model where only the gravitational potential of the gas is considered. 

To investigate the impact of the SMBH on the kinematics of J0109–3047 further, we construct a simple 

pared to the model without a gap. Moreover, a central gap in the gas distribution would be at odds with simulations and observations where the central ∼400−500 pc
 \(\sim 400-500\ \rm{pc}\)\(\sim 400-500\ \rm{pc}\)the
 region contains up to \(\sim 10\)2022
 times the mass of the BH in
 gas (e.g.,  Lupi et al. 2022 ;  Walter et al. 2022 ). 

In summary, the flat velocity dispersion profile implies a flat radial mass density profile. The constant

The intensity profile is assumed to be exponentially declining as in the constant dispersion model (see Section  3 ). We note that any additional contribution (besides the central SMBH) to the kinematics as a constant is in agreement with the inferred gas mass profile (see Fig.  4 ). 

In Fig. 5  we show the best-fit dispersion fields for 

dispersion implies that the underlying mass distribution is not centrally peaked, consistent with the expectations of the gas mass distribution derived from the far-infrared continuum emission under standard assumptions. This leaves only few alternatives to explain the absence of a central peak in the velocity dispersion. One possibility is that the gas mass decreases in the central

 \(10^{8}\ M_{\odot}\)to
 \(10^{9}\ M_{\odot}\). We find that the [C  II ] kinematics of J0109–3047 are clearly incompatible with a \(\sim 10^{9}\ M_{\odot}\)the
 SMBH. A full MCMC fit of the model to the data yields an upper limit of \(M_{\rm{SMBH}}<6.5\times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}(2\sigma)\)(see Appendix
  for the full posterior distribution of the model parameters). However, even for the maximum-likelihood model (MBH =
 \(M_{\rm{BH}}=2.4\times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}\)\(M_{\rm{BH}}=2.4\times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}\)model
 ), the BIC is slightly higher than for a model without a black hole (
 \(\Delta\rm{BIC}=5.2\)), showing that
 any SMBH contribution to the dispersion velocity field is disfavored by the observations. 

we have previously excluded the presence of a central gap in the [C  II ]–emitting gas, and the FIR continuum shows no sign of a central gap either. A decrease in the central gas mass would imply fine-tuning of the physical properties of the ISM at the center of J0109–3047 (to ‘offset’ the mass of the SMBH). If such a conspiracy is excluded, the black hole mass is either smaller than expected, as discussed in this section, or the black hole is not located at the center of the galaxy as traced by the dust continuum, as discussed in the next section. 

If confirmed, and applicable to the larger population 

One way to alleviate the tension with the rest-frame UV mass measurement could be to change the radial [C  II ]–emitting gas profile. By definition, the observed [C  II ] kinematics are a luminosity–weighted, beam– convolved realisation of the intrinsic kinematics. Following Eq.  1 , the velocity dispersion increases exponentially close to the black hole, and due to the exponential intensity profile, these inner regions will contribute more to the beam–convolved velocity dispersion measurement in the center. As a result, the observed velocity dispersion could be reduced, if the [C  II ] intensity profile is not increasing close to the black hole (for example due to feedback). 

To address this further, we have used a toy model where the gas density profile follows an exponentially declining profile with a central gap where the [C  II ] emission is null. As in the fiducial model, the velocity dispersion is composed of the SMBH component and 

of \(z>6\)luminous quasars, a mass of
 \(\sim 10^{8}M_{\odot}\)for the SMBH in J0109–3047 would have several interesting implications for early SMBH growth and formation. First, it would alleviate the need for massive seeds and/or super–Eddington accretion events at z > 7 (e.g., Ba˜
nados
 \(z>7\)\(z>7\)et al. 2018 ;  Wang et al. 2021 ;  Volonteri et al. 2021 ). Second, a SMBH mass of
 \(10^{8}M_{\odot}\)\(10^{8}M_{\odot}\)Second, a SMBH mass of 108M⊙for a total galaxy (dynamical) mass of 2.34 × 1010 M⊙(see Section 4) would

 ) would
 (see Section ) would place it on the local relation, meaning that J0109–3047 is not part of an overmassive SMBH population at \(z>6\)( Pensabene et al. 2020 ;  Neeleman et al. 2021 ), and the offset from the local relation seen in the \(z>6\)luminous
 quasar sample could be due to systematic overestimation of black hole masses. Third, the accreting BH at the heart of J0109–3047 would be definitive evidence for super–Eddington accretion at \(z>6\)with an Eddington
 ratio \(\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}\gtrsim 5\).
 

## 6.  AN OFFSET OR RECOILING SMBH AT REDSHIFT Z=6.79? The previous section relied on the assumption that 

a constant. We use this simple model to calculate the size of the central gap necessary to “hide” the SMBH impact on the [C  II ] kinematics tracer. We find that, for a SMBH with a fixed mass \(M_{\rm{BH}}=1.1\times 10^{9}M_{\odot}\), the best-fit central gap is constrained to be \(r<22\ \rm{pc}\)(
 \(2\sigma\)) to reproduce the [C  II ] profile and kinematics. The best-fit model has \(r_{\rm{pc}}=0.015^{+0.015}_{-0.010}\ \rm{pc}\)(see Appendix
 ), and is formally ruled out with an increased

the black hole is located at the center of the host FIR continuum emission. However, if the accreting SMBH is not located at the center of the host galaxy, the [C  II ] kinematics are not expected to be strongly influenced
