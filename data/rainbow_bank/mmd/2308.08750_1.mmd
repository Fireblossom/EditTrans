coupled WGM resonators to achieve multi-band UR of photons through modulation of the intermode backscatterings of resonators[ 41 ]. In the 

tem parameters, we demonstrate the simultaneous realization of UR and unidirectional transmissionlessness (UT). Moreover, the conversion between UR and UT can be achieved by adjusting the coupling strength between WGM resonators and optical fiber. Additionally, a one-to-one correspondence is established between the resonant frequencies of QDs energy levels and the positions of UR and UT peaks. 

reciprocal system that the equivalent transmission in both directions was exhibited. Obviously, these systems previously mentioned only investigated the transmission or reflection characteristics, without considering achieving complete nonreciprocity in both channels, whereas directional transport in both channels is vital to enhance the controllability of photons. 

## Model and calculations 

To this end, we propose a non-reciprocal system consisting of two WGM resonators that are individually embedded with a Zeeman split quantum dot (QD)[ 42 – 44 ] and indirectly coupled through an optical fiber. By optimizing some sys- 

The schematic of system is shown in Fig. 1  (a) and energy levels of QD is shown in Fig. 1  (b). Assuming that the WGM resonators and QDs have the same loss rates \(\gamma\), then the Hamiltonian of the system can be written as (assuming \(\hbar=1\)\(\hbar=1\))
