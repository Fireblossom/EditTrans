## Appendix C: Extraction of Quasiparticle Density 

## Near Qubit 

## Appendix D: Diffusion of Quasiparticles in Superconducting Quantum-Classical Hybrid Circuits 

Most QPs propagate diffusively when the local QP density is relatively low. The local QP density is \(x_{\mathrm{QP}}=n_{\mathrm{QP}}/n_{\mathrm{CP}}\), where \(n_{\mathrm{QP}}\) is the QP density and \(n_{\mathrm{CP}}\)the Cooper pair density. As the local QP density increases, QPs have a greater probability of recombination, 

The \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) extracted using \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}=(\Gamma(t)-\Gamma_{0})/{C}\)\(T_{1}\) is a kind of average QP density during the \(T_{1}\)\(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\)(
 \(\sim\,T_{1}\)) after
 \(t_{\mathrm{R}}\). To
 \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\) ( \(\sim\,T_{1}\)the
 ) after \(t_{\mathrm{R}}\). To intuitively illustrate the validity of the \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\)\(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\)intuitively illustrate the validity of the xQP,qubit evolution extracted in this way to analyze the QP propagation
 mechanism, we compare (i) the \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) extracted with a very short measurement time ( \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\,=\,0\)\(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\,=\,0\)very short measurement time (tavg = 0) in an ideal measurement, and (ii) the xQP,qubit extracted with several
 \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\)extracted with several
 \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) extracted with several microsecond measurement times ( \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}=3,\ 6,\ 12,\ 18\ \mu s\)) in a real experiment. We assume that the gray curve 

and phonon-mediated propagation becomes the leading mechanism. We calculated the diffusion equation by finite element simulation, thereby estimating the contribution of QP diffusion to the QP propagation in the device described in the paper. We set a boundary of 

( \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\,=0\)) in the Fig. 9 below, which is similar to the
 trend of the extracted \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\)\(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\)trend of the extracted xQP,qubit evolution in the maintext, is the real QP density evolution. The trends and
 timescales ( \(\sim\)over
 several microseconds) of \(x_{\mathrm{QP,qubit}}\) evolution vary little over all values of \(t_{\mathrm{avg}}\) listed. 

**(a)**  Pulse sequence applied to measure qubits state after an SFQ pulse train. The transmission of the readout resonator is measured at \(f_{\mathrm{r}}\). ** (b)**  Qubit readout resonator spectroscopy vs. DC/SFQ converter drive pulse duration \(t_{\mathrm{SFQ}}\). ** (c)** Pulse sequence applied to measure qubits state with variable delay \(t_{\mathrm{dalay}}\) after a 25 \(\mu\mathrm{s}\)SFQ pulse train. The transmission of the
 readout resonator is measured at \(f_{\mathrm{r}}\). ** (d)**  Qubit readout resonator spectroscopy vs. delay between SFQ circuit operation and readout pulse \(t_{\mathrm{dalay}}\). The frequencies corresponding to the readout resonator when the state of qubit is \(\left|0\right\rangle\), \(\left|1\right\rangle\), and punch out have been marked.
