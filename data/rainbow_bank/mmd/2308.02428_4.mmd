where \(\delta_{nm}\) is the Kronecker delta symbol. Such relation leads to the definition of the Laguerre transform of order \(\nu\): 



\[\mathcal{T}^{\nu}[f(x)]=\left\{\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x}x^{\nu}L_{n }^{\nu}(x)f(x)dx\right\}=\{c^{\nu}_{n}\},\] (11)  

it must be emphasize that the Laguerre transform is a sequence of numbers in \(\mathbb{C}\). The inverse Laguerre transform is defined by 

\[f(x)=\mathcal{(T^{\nu})}^{-1}[\{c_{n}^{\nu}\}]=\sum_{k=0}^{ \infty}c^{\nu}_{n}L_{n}^{\nu}(x).\] (12)  



## Examples of applications 

### Applications to the Schr¨ odinger equation 

In this section is consider the equation 



\[-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^{2}}{dr^{2}}\psi(r)-(V(r)+E)\psi(r)=0\] (13)  

which in appropriate units ( \(\hbar\)=M=1) is the steady state Sch¨ odinger equation defined in a one dimensional space, where \(V(r)\)is a potential function and
 \(E\) is the energy. Under the change of coordinates (see [0]), given by \(\lambda^{-1}\xi(x)=dx/dr\), where \(\lambda\geq 0\)has inverse length units, equation (13) becomes
 

\[\lambda^{2}\xi^{2}\left[\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}\psi(x)+\frac{1}{\xi} \frac{d\xi}{dx}\frac{d}{dx}\psi(x)-\frac{2}{\lambda^{2}\xi^{2}}W(x)\psi(x) \right]=0,\] (14)  

where \(W(x)=V(r)-E\). To obtain a Laguerre-type equation the change of , leads to \(\xi(x)=x^{a}e^{bx}\). coordinates must satisfy \(x(r)\geq 0\)and setting
 \(\frac{1}{\xi}\frac{d\xi}{dx}=\frac{a}{x}\)

In this way, equation (14) becomes 

\[\lambda^{2}\xi^{2}\left[\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}\psi(x)+\left(\frac{a }{x}+b\right)\frac{d}{dx}\psi(x)+\left(A_{+}+\frac{A_{-}}{x^{2}}-\frac{A_{0}}{ x}\right)\psi(x)\right]=0,\] (15)  



where \(A_{\pm},A_{0},a,b\) are real parameters determined in terms of \(V(r)\)and
 \(E\). 

To solve equation (15) it is proposed a solution of the form 

\[\psi(x)=x^{\alpha}e^{-\beta x}y(x),\] (16)  

\(\nu\), and \(\alpha,\beta,\nu\) are dimensionless parameters, free for the moment, but to be determined according to the concrete examples to be solved below. where \(y=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}c_{k}L_{k}^{\nu}(x)\), and
 \(L_{n}^{\nu}(x)\)are the Laguerre polynomials of order
 

To solve (15) the use of the finite Laguerre transform is introduced. Many of the following transforms are known [0] or are obtained by direct calculation by using Laguerre polynomial properties found in [0] or in [0].
