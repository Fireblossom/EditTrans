and scales like \(m_{\nu}^{4}\)such that the dynamical friction effect is dominated by the most massive neutrino eigenstate. We may then assume a single neutrino species for simplicity, or explicitly write the total dynamical friction force as a sum of individual contribution from different eigenstates. 

In order to connect Eq. ( 3.19 ) with the results of future sections, it is convenient to rewrite it in terms of a quantity with dimension of inverse time. Since \(F=Mdv_{\textrm{H}}/dt\), we can define: 

\[\tau^{-1}=-\frac{\vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}_{\textrm{H}}}{Mv_{\textrm{H}}^{2}}=\frac{ 2}{3\pi}\log\Lambda G^{2}Mm_{\nu}^{4}=3.4\times 10^{-5}\frac{\log\Lambda}{\log 1 00}\frac{M}{10^{13}M_{\bigodot}}\left(\frac{m_{\nu}}{0.1\textrm{eV}}\right)^{4 }H_{0}\,,\] (27)  

which is the characteristic time scale for an order one fractional decrease in the halo velocity due to the dynamical friction effect. Note that
 \(1/\tau H_{0}=\Delta v/v\) is the overall relative decrease in the halo velocity over the age of the Universe \(t\sim 1/H_{0}\). We obtain a numerical value of
 \(\Delta v/v=3.4\times 10^{-5}\)for a halo mass \(M=10^{13}M_{\bigodot}\)and individual neutrino mass \(m_{\nu}=0.1\)eV, when also assuming
 \(\Lambda=100\).
 This already suggests that the dynamical friction effect is quite small, although it can pick up some significant contributions from the clustering of nearby halos as we will see in Sec.  5 . 

### Limitations to the 1-halo approach 

Thus far we have determined the anisotropic clustering of massive neutrinos behind moving point mass halos and the corresponding dynamical friction force. A more realistic calculation would have to account for both the finite extent of the halo and the presence of large-scale structure. Indeed, the Eq. ( 3.20 \(\log\Lambda\), where in typical applications of the
 \(\Lambda\)can be estimated as the ratio of maximum and minimum
 impact parameters,
 \(\Lambda\sim b_{\textrm{max}}/b_{\textrm{min}}\). Here
 \(b_{\textrm{min}}\sim R_{\rm halo}\) is the halo radius, and \(b_{\textrm{max}}\sim\lambda_{\textrm{coh}}\sim 0.1\)sufficiently
 Mpc _-1_is the CDM velocity coherence scale. The CDM bulk flow is only coherent over sufficiently small scales and hence our analysis based on a single moving halo is expected to break down at scales \(\lambda\gtrsim\lambda_{\textrm{coh}}\). 3 This point will be made more clear in the next section, where we also provide a precise definition for the velocity coherence scale. 3 We should also impose a cutoff corresponding to the distance traveled by free-streaming neutrinos, which sets the scale where neutrino inhomogeneities are coherent with CDM. As we shall see the neutrino free-streaming scale

 choice of halo formation redshift of \(z_{\textrm{i}}=1\), and the dashed blue curve to
 \(z_{\textrm{i}}=2\). In realistic applications we
 might expect
 \(\Lambda\approx\lambda_{\rm{coh}}/R_{\rm halo}\approx 10-1000\)as we will see in Sec.
 .
