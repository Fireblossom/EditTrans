# Unique continuation for an elliptic interface problem using unfitted isoparametric finite elements 

##### Abstract
We study unique continuation over an interface using a stabilized unfitted finite element method tailored to the conditional stability of the problem. The interface is approximated using an isoparametric transformation of the background mesh and the corresponding geometrical error is included in our error analysis. To counter possible destabilizing effects caused by non-conformity of the discretization and cope with the interface conditions, we introduce adapted regularization terms. This allows to derive error estimates based on conditional stability. Numerical experiments suggest that the presence of an interface seems to be of minor importance for the continuation of the solution beyond the data domain. On the other hand, certain convexity properties of the geometry are crucial as has already been observed for many other problems without interfaces.
