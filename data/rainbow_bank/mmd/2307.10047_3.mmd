## RESULTS 

### Phase diagram for isotropic HS-like configurations 

In this section we investigate the magnetic order as 

\(N\). An extrapolation of the positions of the maxima of those peaks vs
 \(1/N\) provides a value for the transition temperature, \(T_{c}(\Phi=0.4)\simeq 1.9(1)\)\(1/N\)provides
 \(\chi_{m}\)the

 , in agreement with the estimated \(T_{c}\) obtained from the analysis of Fig. 1(a). For \(T<T_{c}\) we find that \(\chi_{m}\) does not diverge with \(N\), a fact that validates the above conclusions on FM order. All that is in contrast to the results obtained for
 \(\Phi=0.1\),
 shown in Fig. 2(c) where we see how the values of \(\chi_{m}\)increase with \(N\) for low \(T\). Data are consistent with a trend \(\chi_{m}\sim N^{p}\)for \(p\approx 0.45\)and
 \(T\lesssim 0.2\). This behavior
 suggests the existence of a SG phase.

 fluids in the range
 \(0<\Phi\lesssim 0.49\).
 \(\Phi\)measures the degree
 of spatial disorder on such configurations. We will show \(\Phi\)(which means increasing disorder)
 SG order replaces the FM order. 

A first overview can be grasped from Figs. 1-2. 

The plots in Fig. 3 show that the FM order persists at 

the FM order disappears. Mean-field calculations predict that FM order persists for
 \(\Phi\geq\Phi_{c}=\pi/20\sim 0.157\).

Fig. 1(a) displays plots of the specific heat \(c\) vs \(T\) for \(\Phi=0.4\). The curves exhibit a marked lambda-shaped
 peak. Their evident dependence on the number of NP indicates the presence of a singular point in the curve that corresponds to \(N\to\infty\)at \(T_{c}\approx 1.9\). That singular
 behavior is expected in PM-FM second order transitions. Data are consistent with a logarithmic divergence of \(c\)with \(N\). Fig. 1(b) shows the plots obtained for
 \(\Phi=0.1\).
 In contrast to the previous ones, these plots are smooth and depend little on the sample size. So, there is no sign of any singular behavior. This is expected in PM-SG 

\(\Phi=0.18\). The curves of
 \(m_{1}\) vs \(T\) in panel (a) indicate an increase in magnetization with \(N\) at low \(T\), although they also exhibit relevant finite size effects. The Binder parameter of panel (b) allows to determine the transition \(N\rightarrow\infty\)in FM phases, while from
 \(N\rightarrow\infty\)in FM phases, while from the law of large numbers it follows that in PM phases \(B_{m}\to 0\)as
 \(N\) increases. On the other hand, since \(B_{m}\) is dimensionless, it must be independent of \(N\)\(N\)dimensionless, it must be independent of N at the critical point.

Fig. 4. The qualitatively different results illustrate the \(\Phi\).
 The plots of the magnetization in panel (a) show that \(m_{1}\) gradually decreases as \(N\) increases for all \(T\). The data of \(m_{1}\)for
 low temperature agree with an algebraic decay \(m_{1}\sim N^{p}\)
