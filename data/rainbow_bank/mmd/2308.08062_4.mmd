dent points at the sky plane to fit the five ellipse parameters. The global elliptical limb is determined by minimizing the classical \(\chi^{2}\)function. The quality of the result is given by the \(\chi^{2}\)per degree of freedom \(\chi^{2}_{\rm pdf}=\chi^{2}/(N-M)\approx 1\)for satisfactory fits, where
 \(N\)is the number of points and \(M\) is the number of fitted parameters ( Gomes-Júnior et al. 2022 ). A set of empirical tests 9 assuming topography values between 0 and 10 km were performed and revealed a good fit ( \(\chi^{2}_{\rm pdf}=0.92\)) when features of 7 km were
 considered. This result agrees with the theoretical approach proposed by  Johnson and McGetchin  ( 1973 ), which gives a lower limit of 6 to 7 km for topography on MS4 (see Sect.  3.4 ). 

cause the GPS was connected to the computer and it presented a large o ff set with respect to all close-by chords; 5) Artemis because its length does not match the length of Catania’s chord (at 1 \(\sigma\) level), which probed exactly the same object’s profile but is a bit larger. 6) Finally, Caussols, Ariana, and Kuban have larger uncertainties than other chords that probed the same region. In addition to the eight GPS data sets, we selected another five positive chords acquired from Méo station, Mátraszentistván, Hvar, Agerola, and La Palma. The main criteria for selecting the mentioned NTP chords were: data acquired with professional telescopes, low dispersion in the light curves, and the smallest uncertainties of the probed limb.

 from this plot for better visualization: TAROT, Lleida, Khmelnytskyi, Fuensanta de Martos, Kharkiv T36, and Marbella. The green lines represent positions compatible with the total target’s flux within the noise (i.e., no secondary occultation). The order of positive chords, from north to south, is the same as in Table  3 .
