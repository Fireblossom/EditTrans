### 2.3 Metrics 

Three metrics were widely used across the papers: accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. The equations for these four metrics can be seen below. 

\[\text{Accuracy}=\frac{\text{Correctly classified speech}}{\text{Total speech samples}}\] (1)  

\[\text{Specificity}=\frac{\text{Correctly classified healthy speech}}{\text{ Total healthy speech}}\] (2)  

\[\text{Sensitivity}=\frac{\text{Correctly classified pathological speech}}{ \text{Total pathological speech}}\] (3)  

Another metric was often used in the papers using multi-class classification - unweighted average recall (UAR). This metric is calculated by averaging the recall value for each of the specific pathologies included in the dataset. Equation 4 shows how it is calculated, where N is the number of pathologies in the dataset and \(R_{i}\) is the recall of the ith pathology in the dataset. 

\[\text{UAR}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{R_{i}}}{N}\] (4)  

### 2.4 Binary Classification Literature
