 $V_1$hopping processes, which naturally result in the formation of a Fermi surface similar to the one in graphene at

 At $\nu=1/6$, the connected density-density correlation function relative to the site marked in green shows clear signatures
 of sublattice polarized CO with a tripled unit cell. (c) The long-range character is substantiated by the finite value of the extrapolation of the static charge structure factor peak at $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{K}$ to the TDL. For fillings with solid lines in (a), the ground state is completely unique, while for dashed ones it is only unique in its symmetry sector. Red/blue outlined circles in (b) correspond to sites on the $A$/ $B$ sublattice. The clusters used are $\mathbf{u}_1=(1,4),\mathbf{u}_2=(5,-4),N=48$for (a), and
 $\mathbf{u}_1=(3,3),\mathbf{u}_2=(3,-6),N=54$for (b).
