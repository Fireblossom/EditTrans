between these works and ours is that they assume the buyer is _ fully strategic_  and processes fully how their actions today affect the seller’s decisions tomorrow (whereas we instead model buyers as no-regret learners). 

The most related work to ours is in the [BMSW18] model itself. Here we provide a brief summary of the main results in [BMSW18] and their connection to our main results. [BMSW18] studies the one seller one buyer scenario, where the buyer employs a mean-based no-regret algorithm. The authors present three results, each obtained under different assumptions regarding the behavior of the buyers. Firstly (as we have already mentioned earlier in the introduction), [BMSW18] shows that for vanilla mean-based no-regret buyers, [BMSW18] can extract revenue that is an arbitrarily large fraction of the bidder’s expected value. Our Theorem 4 extends this result to the multiple buyer setting, overcoming novel technical and conceptual challenges. Second, [BMSW18] designs a novel (not mean-based) learning algorithm against which the optimal mechanism for the seller is simply Myerson’s auction in each round. Their proof of this result naturally accommodates multiple buyers. Finally, [BMSW18] shows that if the buyer is clever and mean-based no regret (where they do not overbid their value), then the optimal auction has a clean tractable format (pay-your-bid with declining reserve over time). As we have discussed in the “No Overbidding” section of the introduction, our work shows several formal barriers in extending these results to multiple buyers. In summary, our main result extends their first main result to multiple bidders. Their second result already holds for multiple bidders (so there is nothing for us to extend). Our secondary results establish formal barriers to extending their final main result to multiple bidders. 

Two recent follow-ups have extended the setting in [BMSW18] in a different direction. First, [DSS19b] considers the problem of playing a two-player game against a no-regret learner. While technically not an auctions problem, there is thematic overlap with our main result. [DSS19a] extends the single-buyer results in [BMSW18] to be _ prior-free_ . Specifically, they show how to design auctions achieving the same guarantees as those in [BMSW18] but where the buyer’s values are chosen adversarially. In comparison to these works, ours is the first to extend the model to consider multiple buyers. 

Finally, recent work of [CHJ20] considers interaction between a learning buyer and a _ learning_ seller. Their seller does not have a prior against which to optimize, and instead itself targets a noregret guarantee. In comparison, our seller (like the seller in all previously cited works) optimizes expected revenue with respect to a prior. 

## Preliminaries We consider the same setting as [BMSW18], extended to multiple buyers. Specifically, there are \(n\) buyers and \(T\) rounds. In each round, there is a single item for sale. Each buyer \(i\) has value \(v_{i,t}\)for the item during round \(t\), and each \(v_{i,t}\) is drawn from \(\mathcal{D}\) independently (that is, the buyers are i.i.d., and the rounds are i.i.d. as well). For simplicity of exposition (and to match prior work), we assume \(\mathcal{D}\)has finite support
 \(0\leq w_{1}<w_{2}<\ldots<w_{m}\leq 1\)and we define
 \(q_{j}\) to be the probability \(w_{j}\) is drawn from \(\mathcal{D}\). 

Each round, the seller presents \(K\) arms for the buyers. Each arm is labeled with a bid, and we \(0\)(to represent a bid of “don’t participate”). Note that
 the same set of arms is presented to all buyers, and the same set of arms is presented in each round. 

In each round \(t\), the seller defines an anonymous auction. Specifically, for all \(i,t\), the seller defines
