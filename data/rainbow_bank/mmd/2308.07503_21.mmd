where \(S_{n}(u)=\,e^{-B_{S}}\psi_{s_{n}}(u)\). To get the normalization constant we first consider the asymptotic expansion of the normalizable solution, \(S_{n}(u)\), close to the boundary, \(S_{n}(u)=N_{s_{n}}u^{3}+\cdots\) , where \(N_{s_{n}}\) is the normalization constant, which is obtained by plugging \(S_{n}(u)\)in ( 4.3 ). Then decay constants of the scalar mesons are given by the following dictionary 

\[F_{s_{n}}=\zeta\,u\,e^{3A_{s}-\Phi}\partial_{u}S_{n}\bigg{|}_{u=\epsilon}=3 \frac{\sqrt{N_{c}}}{2\pi}\,N_{s_{n}}.\] (57)  

We first investigate the behavior of the scalar meson decay constants as a function of the parameter \(a_{0}\) in the chiral limit with the other parameters fixed as in model A. Our numerical results are displayed on the left panel of Fig.  14 . As can be seen from the plot, the results show a smooth behavior of the decay constants in the region of interest, i.e., \(a_{0}<a_{0}^{c}\), where \(a_{0}^{c}\approx 0.0974\). However, the behavior of the decay constant increases close to \(a_{0}^{c}\)for the ground state while it decreases for the scalar resonances. 

In addition, we calculate the scalar meson decay constants as a function of the quark mass. Our numerical results are displayed on the right panel of Fig.  14 . As can be seen from the plot, the decay constant increases in the region of small quark mass until it reaches some maximum value and then decreases when the quark mass grows. Finally, we calculate the decay constant using the final set of parameters for models A and B displayed in Table  1 .

The decay constants of the vector mesons (in MeV) obtained in our work (same result for models A and B), compared against the result obtained using the soft wall model (SW) [ 13 ]. In order to compare with experimental results of [ 78 ], we need to identify \(F_{V}\) with \(g_{\rho}\).
