This iteration was introduced by Nadel in [31] where he also proved that periodic points of order two or three must be K¨ ahler-Einstein metrics. This was generalized [20, 33] to periodic points \(\omega\)of any order, that is, those satisfying \(\rho^{k}_{\omega}=\lambda\omega\) for any \(k\in\mathbb{N}\)if
 . The iteration (3) can be regarded as a discretization of the K¨ ahler–Ricci flow. Observe that, if the manifold \(M\) is compact, by Calabi’s conjecture one does not need positivity assumptions to reverse the construction above and define the _ inverse Ricci–K¨_ _ahler iterations_ \(\rho^{-k}_{\omega}\). Both of this discrete dynamical systems have been studied in the literature, see for instance [5, 13]. 

Here we focus on the following generalized Monge-Amp` ere equation on a complex manifold \(M\)

(4) \[\rho^{k}_{\omega}=\lambda\Omega\]  

where \(\Omega\)is again a K¨ \(\Omega\)where Ωis again a K¨
ahler form. In particular we study equation (4) for a special class of wellbehaved K¨
ahler metrics. Our second result is the following theorem dealing with K¨
ahler metrics
 ahler metrics. Our second result is the following theorem dealing with K¨ ahler metrics induced by the flat metric (which are well-behaved by Example 4 below). 

**Theorem 2.** _ Let_ \(M\)_ be a complex manifold with two metrics_ \(g\)_ and_ \(G\)_ induced by the flat metric. If_ _the corresponding K¨_ _ahler forms_ \(\omega,\Omega\)_satisfy_ \(\rho_{\omega}^{k}=\lambda\Omega\)_for some_ \(k\geqslant 1\)_ and_ \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\)_, then_ \((M,g)\)_ is a_ _totally geodesic submanifold of the flat ambient space._ 

Observe that this result can be seen as a generalization of [40, Theorem 2.1]. Namely, when \(k=1\) and \(g=G\), Theorem 2 shows that a K¨ ahler–Einstein submanifolds of \(\mathbb{C}^{n}\)with the flat metric is necessarily Ricci-flat, hence a totally geodesic submanifold. It is worth pointing out that the metric \(g\) is assumed to be induced by a flat one for simplicity, but the hypothesis on \(g\) can be sensibly relaxed, cf. Remark 11 below. 

Our third and last result deals with K¨ ahler–Ricci solitons (KRS). Recall that a K¨ ahler metric \(G\)is a KRS if there exists a holomorphic vector field \(X\) (the solitonic vector field) such that \(\mathrm{Ric}(G)=\mu G+L_{X}G\) where \(\mathrm{Ric}(G)\) denotes the Ricci tensor of \(G\) and \(L_{X}\) the Lie derivative in the direction of \(X\). K¨ ahler–Ricci solitons are important generalizations of K¨ ahler–Einstein metrics which arise in the study of the K¨ ahler–Ricci flow. Our next result show that KRS cannot arise as K¨ ahler–Ricci iterations of metrics induced by complex space forms. 

**Theorem 3.** _ Let_ \(M\)_ be a complex manifold with two real analytic K¨_ _ahler metrics_ \(g\)_ and_ \(G\)_. Assume_ _that_ \(g\)_ is induced by a complex space form and_ \(G\)_ is a KRS. If the corresponding K¨_ _ahler forms_ \(\omega,\Omega\)_satisfy_ \(\rho_{\omega}^{k}=\lambda\Omega\)_for some_ \(\lambda\neq 0\)_ and_ \(k\geqslant 0\)_, then_ \(G\)is trivial, i.e. K
 hler–Einstein.
 

Observe that, when \(\lambda=0\), one cannot draw any conclusion. Take for instance \(g\) to be the flat metric on \(\mathbb{C}\) and \(G\) to be Hamilton’s cigar KRS [17]. It is worth mentioning that we do not know of any K¨ ahler–Einstein metric \(G\) and K¨ ahler metric \(g\) induced by a complex space form which satisfy \(\rho_{\omega}^{k}=\lambda\Omega\)for \(\lambda<0\) unless \(g=G\) and \(k=1\). In that case \(M\) is forced to be a totally geodesic submanifold in \(\mathbb{C}\mathrm{H}^{n}\)[40]. On the other hand, such examples for \(\lambda>0\) are discussed in Section 3, see in particular Proposition 2. 

Also in this case we generalize some recent results on KRS induced by complex space forms which indeed served as partial motivation for this paper. In particular, if we assume \(k=0\) (and \(\lambda>0\)) in Theorem 3, we recover [25, Theorem 1.1]. If we restrict to compact complex manifolds, then this result can be rephrased in terms of the inverse K¨ \(\rho^{-k}_{\omega}\)of a non-trivial KRS
 \((g,X)\)on
 ahler–Ricci iterations \(\rho^{-k}_{\omega}\)of a non-trivial KRS \((g,X)\) on a compact complex manifold \(M\) can be induced by a complex space form.
