#### Even \(L\) with a fermion parity defect 

Let us introduce a \(\mathsf{G}\) defect. A concrete Hamiltonian to keep in mind is 

\[H_{\mathsf{G}}={i\over 2}\sum_{\ell=1}^{L-1}\chi_{\ell+1}\chi_{ \ell}-{i\over 2}\chi_{1}\chi_{L}\,,\  

where the defect is in the link connecting \((L,1)\). We use the subscript \(\mathsf{G}\) for the Hamiltonian and symmetry operators in the system with a \(\mathsf{G}\) defect. However, we emphasize that for most of our discussion the particular form of the Hamiltonian will not matter. Note that the defect can be moved to other links, e.g., to the link \((1,2)\), by conjugating \(H_{\mathsf{G}}\) by a local \(\mathsf{G}\) transformation, \(\chi_{1}\) or \(\mathsf{g}_{1}\). 

Let us determine the symmetry operators of the theory with the defect. We use the same fermion parity operator \(\mathsf{G}\) as in ( 3.10 ), because it commutes with \(H_{\mathsf{G}}\). 21 On the other hand, instead of ( 3.5 ), the translation operator now acts on the fermion fields as 

Tùñ¶:œá‚Ñì‚ÜíTùñ¶œá‚ÑìTùñ¶‚àí1=‚àë‚Ñì‚Ä≤R(Tùñ¶)‚Ñì,‚Ñì‚Ä≤œá‚Ñì‚Ä≤={œá‚Ñì+1‚Ñì=1,2,‚ãØ,L‚àí1‚àíœá1‚Ñì=L (486.1)  

The algebra satisfied by these operators is 

\[R(\mathsf{G})^{2}=1\,,~{}~{}~{}~{}R(T_{\mathsf{G}})^{L}=R( \mathsf{G})\,,~{}~{}~{}~{}R(\mathsf{G})\,R(T_{\mathsf{G}})=R(T_{\mathsf{G}})\, R(\mathsf{G})\,.\  

In contrast to the case without the defect ( 3.7 ),now we have 

\[\det R(T_{\mathsf{G}})_{\ell,\ell^{\prime}}=+1\,,\ \[\det R(\mathsf{G})_{\ell,\ell^{\prime}}=+1\,.\]  

This means that the twisted translation operator is an \(SO(L)\) transformation and is constructed out of an even number of fermions, i.e., it is bosonic. 

Let us write \(T_{\mathsf{G}}\) in terms of the fermion fields. Again, ( 3.22 ) does not determine its phase normalization, and we will make an arbitrary choice below. Later, in Section  3.3 , we will rescale it to \(T_{\text{NSNS}}\) and compare it to the continuum operators. Its action in ( 3.22 ) means that we should multiply \(T\) by an operator that maps \(\chi_{1}\to-\chi_{1}\).
  and leaves the other fermions unchanged, i.e., we should multiply it by \(\mathsf{g}_{1}=-\chi_{2}\chi_{3}\cdots\chi_{L}\). Therefore, we take [ 81 ] 22 

\[T_{\mathsf{G}}=(-1)^{N}\mathsf{g}_{1}T ={1\over 2^{L-1\over 2}}(1-\chi_{1}\chi_{2})(1-\chi_{2}\chi_{3}) \cdots(1-\chi_{L-1}\chi_{L})\,.\  21 We do not write \(\mathsf{G}_{\mathsf{G}}\) because it is the same as \(\mathsf{G}\). 22 Alternatively, the translation operator for even \(L\) with a defect can be written as 

\[T_{\mathsf{G}}={(-1)^{N}\over 2^{L-1\over 2}}(\chi_{1}-\chi_{2}) (\chi_{2}-\chi_{3})\cdots(\chi_{L-1}-\chi_{L})\chi_{L}\,.\  (Note that in this forms, \(T_{\mathsf{G}}\) does not satisfy the locality condition ( 1.15 ).)
