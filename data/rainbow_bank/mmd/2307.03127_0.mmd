##### Abstract.
Abstract.  This paper quantitatively investigates the structure of non-compactness of the optimal weighted Sobolev-Lorentz embedding with homogeneous weights in an open convex cone. We prove the optimal embedding in question and obtain the exact values of all injective strict _ s_ -numbers (in particular, the Bernstein numbers) of the embedding. Opposite to the earlier results in this direction, the non-compactness in this case does not occur uniformly over all sub-domains of the underlying domain. Despite that, we find an infinitely dimensional subspace restricted onto which the embedding is isomorphic, proving that the embedding is not strictly singular. 

## 1.  Introduction It is a truth generally acknowledged that Sobolev embeddings hold a prominent position in various areas of mathematics, making comprehensive understanding of their internal structure and behavior essential. One of their oft-studied aspects is their compactness and its quality. Quite often the quality of compactness is analyzed through the decay rate of different \(s\)-numbers. Various \(s\)-numbers are closely related to the spectral theory of the corresponding differential operators associated with Sobolev-type embeddings and provide estimates for the growth of their eigenvalues (see [ 14 ]). There is quite extensive literature in which the quality of compactness of Sobolev embeddings is investigated. However, significantly less attention has been devoted to studying the structure of non compact Sobolev embeddings, where the measure of non-compactness may be related to the shape of the essential spectrum (see [12]). 

Naturally, there are several ways which Sobolev embeddings can become non-compact, such as: 

(a) when the underlying domain is unbounded (see [1], cf. [15]); (b)  when the boundary of the underlying domain is excessively irregular (see [ 20  21  25 26]; (c)  when the target function norm is overly strongâ€”in other words, the target function space is too close to the optimal one (see [19, 24] and references therein). 

Among these possibilities, the last one is particularly intriguing because it has not been explored quantitatively nearly as much as the others, despite the interest in optimal Sobolev embeddings (e.g., see [ 10 ] and references therein). Previous works investigating the case (c) (see [ 4  18  22  23 ]) dealt with Sobolev embeddings that are non-compact
