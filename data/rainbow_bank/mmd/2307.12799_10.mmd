that, for the same projection point, the higher height indicates that the transmission link is more likely to be LoS, which means the signal strength from the interfering UAV becomes stronger. Hence, when the misalignment for the beamforming is non-negligible, the lower deployment of UAVs is preferred for both schemes. Under the case of perfect beam alignment, from Fig. 6(b), it can be seen that the outage probability of MAPAS is smaller for the lower height of UAVs. The explanation is the same as before. However, in terms of the performance of CDAS, it seems that the outage probability for the higher altitude of UAVs can be better. This is mainly because of the fact the UE is associated with the closest UAV and their link can be either LoS or NLoS. As mentioned before, for the same projection point, the link from UAV at the lower height is much more likely to be NLoS, which reduces the desired signal strength at the UE whereby degrading the outage performance. 

### D. Effect of UAV Density 

Fig. 7 plots the outage probability versus the number of 

beam alignment case, an excessive number of antennas is adverse to the network coverage probability. As for the perfect beam alignment case, Fig. 6(b) shows that, as the number of antennas becomes large, the outage probability decreases, and the trend of decreasing gradually slows down. This figure implies that from the perspective such as hardware cost, it is not necessary to equip the UAV with too many antennas since the performance gain is very small. 

### C. Effect of UAV Deployment Height With regards to the effect of UAV deployment height, 

antennas for UAV under different UAV densities for both imperfect and perfect alignment cases. Under the imperfect beam alignment scenario, as expected, the outage probability drops at first and then rises with the increase in the number of antennas. Moreover, since more interfering UAVs are involved in the system, the higher UAV density leads to worse outage probability performance. Besides that, Fig. 7(a) shows that the optimal number of UAV antennas increases as the UAV density rises, e.g., for MAPAS, the optimal number antennas is 4 for \(\lambda_{k}=0.5\times 10^{-5}\ \rm{m}^{-2}\)while it goes to 16 for \(\lambda_{k}=5\times 10^{-5}\ \rm{m}^{-2}\). The reason is as follows. When the UAV density is very sparse, the number of interfering UAVs falling into the region covered by the main-lobe beam of the UE is very small. In other words, the interference is not that severe. Then the serving UAV needs to ensure that the typical UE is covered by its main-lobe beam; hence, a larger mainlobe beamwidth (equivalently, a smaller number of antennas) is preferred. However, when the interfering UAVs are very dense, the interference becomes very severe. One way to reduce the interference is to reduce the density of interfering UAVs with main-lobe beam pointed to the typical UE. From our analysis, this can be achieved by narrowing the main-lobe beamwidth. Note that it cannot be too narrow, because this can degrade the signal strength from the serving UAV due to the beam misalignment. Hence, a relatively larger number of antennas is preferred for the case of denser UAVs. Under the perfect beam scenario, for the MAPAS, sparse UAVs lead to a lower outage probability as expected. However, this is not the case for the CDAS. Fig. 7(b) shows that the denser UAVs can even result in a better outage probability, especially when the number of antennas is large. The reason is as follows. When the UAV density is very sparse, the closest UAV (i.e., the serving UAV) can be very far away, which consequently leads to a very weak signal strength from the serving UAV. Increasing the density of UAVs somehow improves the signal strength from the serving 

Fig. 6(a) shows that the higher deployment of UAVs will lead to a larger outage probability under the imperfect alignment case. The reason is as follows. The higher height implies the larger coverage area of the main-lobe beam on certain tiers, which introduces more interference from more UAVs to the typical UE with the main-lobe pointed. When the beam is mispointed, this kind of effect on SINR becomes worse. Besides
