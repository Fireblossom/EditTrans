when measuring the correlation of cities. Although the correlation of cities can be measured from the aspect of POI distribution, the user behavioral transition pattern is a significant factor in the next POI recommendation task, we thus further explore such correlation from the angle of user sequential behaviors. 

**Correlation of Cities w.r.t Behavioral Patterns** . We examine the correlation of cities w.r.t. the categories of usersâ€™ successive POI visits. In particular, given any two cities, \(A^{cat}=[A_{1}^{cat},A_{2}^{cat}...A_{\mathcal{|S|}}^{cat}]\) and \(B^{cat}=[B_{1}^{cat},B_{2}^{cat}...B_{\mathcal{|S|}}^{cat}]\) re fer to the category transition distributions among \(\mathcal{S}\)within
  transition types, e.g., \(A_{1}^{cat}\)denotes the ratio of transition type \(FO\to SS\) within city A. Analogously, the similarity among different cities can be calculated via the Pearson correlation coefficient, shown in Fig. 2(b). Interestingly, we observe that the correlation of cities w.r.t behavioral patterns is quite different from that w.r.t POI distribution. Specifically, PHO and CAL still keep higher similarity, whereas NYC shows comparably lower similarity with PHO and CAL. To further dig out how the four cities are correlated and different over the behavioral patterns, we compare the two most correlated cities (i.e., CAL and PHO) and the two least correlated cities (i.e., NYC and SIN). For ease of presentation, we select the 10 most frequent category transitions for comparison as shown in Fig. 2(c-d), where the \(x\)-axis denotes the category transitions, e.g., \(AE\to CU\)within
  (AE2CU), and the \(y-\)axis shows the proportion of such a transition within a city. We find that the more correlated cities possess consistent distributions over the frequent category transitions and _ vice versa_ . The above observations depict the various correlations between cities, which inspire us to differentiate their influence when transferring knowledge from auxiliary cities to the target city. 

## The Proposed MERec This section presents the proposed MERec, which leverages the correlation of behavioral patterns when transferring knowledge from auxiliary cities to the target city, i.e., paying more attention to more correlated knowledge. 

**Problem Formulation.**  Each city has its unique user set \(\mathcal{U}\)his
  and POI set \(\mathcal{P}\)without sharing any common users and POIs. For user \(u\), all his check-in records, i.e., \({r=(p,c,g,t)}\), are ordered by timestamps as in [22], where \(p,c,g,t\) denote POI \(p\), category \(c\), coordinate \(g\) (i.e., longitude and latitude) and timestamp \(t\). We then split his historical records into sequences by day and obtain two
