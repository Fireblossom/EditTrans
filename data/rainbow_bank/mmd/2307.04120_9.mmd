corresponding statistical estimators. In this case, we also use the LP / B03 / ExD model from the spec- \(z\) as reference to check the impact of the GaZNet redshift in terms of accuracy and scatter. Basically, the results show that, for the same correlations seen in Fig.  3 , the relative bias of the di ff erent configurations is not worsened, meaning that the accuracy of the mass estimates is not a ff ected by the use of the morphoto- \(z\). This is eventually a consequence of the good accuracy of these latter as seen in Fig.  2 . On the other hand, we register an evident increase of the NMAD as a consequence of the morphoto- \(z\) intrinsic statistical errors and outlier fractions, which is also mirrored by the scatter of the residual, at the bottom of the 1-to-1 relations, which is now of the order of 0.23 dex, for
 \(\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}>9\), and 0.49 dex for
 \(\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}<9\), on average. These large scatter at low stellar masses
 are mainly caused by the trend we see that below
 \(\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}=8.5\), where stellar masses are systematically overestimated
 compared to those obtained with the spec- \(z\). This is not an e ff ect that comes from the particular set-up of the fitting procedure, as shown by the comparison of the LP / B03 / ExD / morphoto- \(z\) against the same set-up with spec- \(z\) (bottom / left plot in Fig.  4 ). Even in this latter case, we see that below
 \(\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}=8.5\)the positive bias is similar to the ones of all other configurations.
 We track the motivation of this systematics to some bias of the GaZNet redshifts for a group of objects at very low redshifts ( \(z<0.05\)see Fig.
  2 ), which turn-out to have also low masses. This can be due to some residual contamination from stars, not picked in the spectra classification, or just a failure of the GaZNet predictions at very low- \(z\), which clearly impact the mass predictions. We will come back to this on Sect.  4 . However, still looking at the LP / B03 / ExD / morphoto- \(z\) vs. spec- \(z\), above \(\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}=8.5\), the bias is almost absent and the only relevant ef
 ff ect is the GaZNet redshift scatter that, from the NMAD, is quantified in 0.09. This is confirmed by noticing that the general increase of the NMAD from the spectroscopic sample to the morphoto-metric sample, in Table  2 , is compatible with the sum in quadrature of the NMAD of the former with
 \(0.09\)coming
 from the latter, consistently with some pseudo-Gaussian distributions. This is consistent with a log-normal distribution of the uncertainties of the stellar masses, which are confirmed by the outlier fractions that are all of the order of 5-6% above 2 \(\sigma\) of the 

Stellar mass estimates as for Fig.  3  but using the GaZNet morphoto-metric redshifts.
