power of \(\mathcal{M}_{A}\). While of potential interest, this is unfortunately not demonstrable from the present analysis. 

### 6.2 Impact of magnetic fields on the energetics of sub-structures 

We are also interested in assessing the energetic relevance of magnetic fields over different length scales in the MCs, especially with respect to potentially star-forming structures. For this purpose, we compute the volume term of the magnetic energy and compare it with the kinetic and potential energies. Similar work for the same simulations has been performed by  Ganguly et al.  ( 2022 ), who assess the virial balance of the cloud sub-structures. Here, we extend the range of our analysis to include the dynamics of lower-density gas (between 10 _-24_and 10 _-22_g cm _-3_; _ low-den_  dendrogram analysis, see Table  2 ). The magnetic energy of a given structure is computed as 

The cyan dashed line represents the linear least-squares best fit 

\[E_{\rm B}=\int_{V}\frac{1}{8\pi}|\mathbf{B}|^{2}\mathrm{d}^{3}r,\] (21)  

where the integration is computed over the entire volume \(V\)of the structure. The kinetic energy is computed using the following relation: 

performed on the logarithm of the points for high densities ( \(\rho_{\rm thr}>1.1\times 10^{-21}\)g cm _-3_). The best fit of \(\kappa=0.47\pm 0.03\)is consistent
 with the strong-field limit of \(B\propto\rho^{0.5}\). We have already shown in the previous section (Section  5 ) that our structures are on average highly elongated, and magnetic fields clearly help to deform the shape of the forming structures. It is therefore not unexpected that we find a shallower scaling compared to the weak field limit ( \(\kappa=0.67\)).
 

\[E_{\mathrm{KE}}=\frac{1}{2}\int_{V}\rho(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_{0})^{2}\mathrm{ d}^{3}r.\] (22)  

We see that, while there is no clear transition from the sub- to the 



Here, \(\mathbf{v}_{0}\) is the centre of mass velocity computed from Eq.  17 . The self-gravitating potential energy of a given structure is obtained using the following relation: 

\[E_{\rm PE}=-\frac{1}{2}G\int_{V}\int_{V}\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r})\rho(\mathbf{r^{ \prime}})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r^{\prime}}|}\mathrm{d}^{3}r\mathrm{d}^{3}r^{ \prime},\] (23)  

super-Alfvénic regime, there is clearly a trend that higher Alfvénic Mach numbers are preferentially obtained at the higher density end. This is confirmed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) two-sample test, which compares if two distributions belong to the same population. In this case, we compare the \(\rho_{\rm thr}\)-distributions of structures with \(\mathcal{M}_{A}>1\)\(6\times 10^{-4}\)and
 \(\mathcal{M}_{A}\leq 1\)Myr
 . We find the
 \(p\)-values 3 to be very low: \(6\times 10^{-4}\)at 2 Myr and
 \(5.2\times 10^{-15}\)found
 at 3.5 Myr (see Table ).

Crutcher et al.  ( 2010 ) found that the observed magnetic field distribution is rather flat at low density, in agreement with the idea that

denser clouds are swept up along the magnetic field lines on large scales, while at higher density there is a power-law increase of the magnetic field strength. If spherical clouds start to collapse and the magnetic field is not strong enough to stop the collapse, one expects a power-law slope of \(\kappa=0.5-0.67\)wei
 (see above).
 In the case of our clouds, we find that the high-density end is well consistent with \(\kappa=0.5\), and the lower-density end clearly shows a
 much shallower slope. Nonetheless, there does not seem to be a clear single density at which there is a sharp change in slope. Simulations by  Li et al.  ( 2015 ),  Mocz et al.  ( 2017 ),  Girichidis et al.  ( 2018 ),  Zhang et al.  ( 2019 ) find similarly the lack of a sharp transition density.  Auddy et al.  ( 2022 ) predict that the transition density depends on the fourth 3  If the \(p\)-value is larger than a certain value (typically 0.05), this means that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the sub-Alfvénic and super-Alfvénic structures have the same underlying density distribution.

 both plots, the \(x\)-axis represents the density threshold \(\rho_{\rm thr}\), and the \(y\)-axis represents \(E_{\rm B}/|E_{\rm PE}|\)points
  (left) and \(E_{\rm B}/|E_{\rm KE}|\) (right), respectively. The colours of the points represent their morphologies. Here, for the purpose of understanding the dynamics of low-density gas, we also include the "unclassified" structures (i.e. structures with >5% of their surface cells touching the edge of the analysis box, see Section  3 ). The side panels to the right and top of each plot show the marginal distributions of \(N_{x}/N_{\rm tot}\) for each morphology. Note that, since the definition of \(N_{\rm tot}\) (Eq.  14 ) does not contain unclassified structures, the fractions in the two side panels add up to greater than unity. The filled symbols are molecular structures, while the open symbols are atomic. 

Typically, for low-density structures, which mostly consist of atomic gas, the magnetic energy is either comparable to or much larger than the potential energy (left panel of Fig.  7 ). The magnetic energy is

We can see that the \(p\)-value is low for both 2 and 3.5 Myr, suggesting that sub-Alfvénic and super-Alfvénic structures (corresponding to bluish and reddish points in Fig.  6 , respectively) have statistically significant differences in their density distributions.
