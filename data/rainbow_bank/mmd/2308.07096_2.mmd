approach to utilize ontology to identify and map threats to assets. With the support of formally sound approaches, this process can be streamlined and made more efficient. From an ontology perspective, the authors introduced ThreMA, an ontology-based approach for automating threat modeling in ICT infrastructures. ThreMA provides a standard meta- model that describes the infrastructure and a set of rules for threat modeling. The meta-model consists of three ontolo- gies modules: ICT ontology for modeling the infrastructure, Data Flow ontology for representing data flow diagrams, and threat ontology for characterizing threats. The use of ontology and inference rules allows for a syntactical representation of the problem, mimicking expert thinking. This approach enhances extensibility, maintainability, and integration in a rapidly changing context. The paper emphasizes the impor- 

tance of using ontologies to address the lack of context and low accuracy in threat modeling. Overall, ThreMA offers a comprehensive ontology-based solution for automating threat modeling in ICT infrastructures. 

## III. M ETHODOLOGY 

This work presents an ontology for representing various data sources about cloud computing and security. This ontology enables a knowledge presentation framework for all cloud computing and its relationships. The ontology consists of sev- eral modules: Cloud Computing and services, Cloud Service underlying components, and CVE module. 

### A. Cloud Computing Stack and Services Ontology Module This section represents our proposed ontology module that covers the cloud computing stack and services. Our extension ontology is provided as a separate ontology, which is an important design criteria in ontology engine engineering [13, 14]. This ontology can be used to unify and provide a primary 

baseline for cloud computing stack, threat understanding, and
