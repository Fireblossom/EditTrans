## 9.  Zeros It is well known that the zeros of orthogonal polynomials with respect to a positive definite linear functional are real, simple, and located in the interior of the convex hull of the support [ 15 ,  20 ]. With this in mind, let \(\{x_{n,k}(z)\}_{k=1}^{n}\)be the the zeros of \(P_{n}(x)\) in an increasing order, i. e., 

\[P_{n}(x_{n,k}(z),z)=0\  

with \[x_{n,1}(z)<x_{n,2}(z)<\cdots<x_{n,n}(z).\]  

Next we will focus our attention on an electrostatic interpretation of the zeros of the polynomial \(P_{n}(x;z)\) in terms of the energy associated with a logarithmic potential and next we will study the dynamics of them in terms of the parameter \(z.\)

### Electrostatic interpretation
 

.
  Evaluating the operator \(D_{n+1}\) defined in ( 5.6 ) at \(x=x_{n+1,k},\) we get 

\[\left.\dfrac{\partial_{x}^{2}P_{n+1}}{\partial_{x}P_{n+1}}\right|_{x=x_{n+1,k} }=-\dfrac{(2x_{n+1,k}-z)}{\phi(x_{n+1,k})}+\dfrac{a_{n+1}}{C_{n}(x_{n+1,k})}\\ +\dfrac{(x_{n,k}-b_{n})C_{n-1}(x_{n,k};z)}{a_{n}\phi(x_{n,k};z)}+\dfrac{\delta _{n}(x_{n,k};z)+\delta_{n-1}(x_{n,k};z)}{\phi(x_{n,k};z)},\]  

where \(C_{n}(x;z)\) and \(\delta_{n}(x;z)\) were defined in Proposition . Taking into account ( 5.4 ) the above expression reads 

\[\left.\dfrac{\partial_{x}^{2}P_{n+1}}{\partial_{x}P_{n+1}}\right| _{x=x_{n+1,k}} =-\dfrac{1}{x_{n+1,k}-z}-\dfrac{1}{x_{n+1,k}}+\dfrac{1}{x_{n+1,k} -\beta_{n}}+1-\dfrac{\alpha}{x_{n+1,k}},\]  

where \(\beta_{n}=-b_{n+1}+(2n+\alpha+z+3)\)\(w(x)=x^{\alpha}e^{-x}=e^{-x+\alpha\ln x}.\). Observe that the weight function associated with \(\boldsymbol{\ell}\)is \(w(x)=x^{\alpha}e^{-x}=e^{-x+\alpha\ln x}.\)),
  If we define \(v(x)=x-\alpha\ln x,\) (the external potential [ 22 , Section 3.5]), then 

\[\left.\dfrac{\partial_{x}^{2}P_{n+1}}{\partial_{x}P_{n+1}}\right| _{x=x_{n+1,k}}=-\dfrac{1}{x_{n+1,k}-z}-\dfrac{1}{x_{n+1,k}}+\dfrac{1}{x_{n+1,k }-\beta_{n}}+v^{\prime}(x_{n+1,k}).\  

Remark
 _ If_ \(\{\widetilde{x}_{n+1,k}(z)\}_{k=1}^{n+1}\)_are the zeros of_ \(Q_{n+1}(x)\)_ in an increasing order, i.e._ 

\[\left.\dfrac{\partial_{x}^{2}Q_{n+1}}{\partial_{x}Q_{n+1}}\right| _{x=\widetilde{x}_{n+1,k}}=-\dfrac{1}{\widetilde{x}_{n+1,k}-z}-\dfrac{1}{ \widetilde{x}_{n+1,k}}+\dfrac{1}{\widetilde{x}_{n+1,k}-\widetilde{\beta}_{n}}+ 1-\dfrac{\alpha+1}{\widetilde{x}_{n+1,k}},\  

\(\widetilde{x}_{n+1,1}<\widetilde{x}_{n+1,2}<\cdots<\widetilde{x}_{n+1,n+1}\)\(\widetilde{x}_{n+1,1}<\widetilde{x}_{n+1,2}<\cdots<\widetilde{x}_{n+1,n+1}\)



_, then we have_ 



_where_ \(\widetilde{\beta}_{n}=-d_{n+1}+(2n+\alpha+z+4)\)_._ 

Theorem
 _ The zeros of_ \(P_{n+1}(x;z)\)_ are the equilibrium points of_ \(n+1\)_ unit_ _charged particles located in the interval_ \((0,z)\)_ under the influence of the external_ _potential_ \[V_{P}(x)=\ln\dfrac{1}{|x-z|}+\ln\dfrac{1}{|x|}-\ln\dfrac{1}{|x-\beta_{n}|}+v(x ),\quad 0<x<z.\]
