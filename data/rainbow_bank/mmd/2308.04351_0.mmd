##### Abstract.
Abstract.  In this work we consider i.i.d. random perturbations of contracting Lorenz maps sufficiently close to a Rovella parameter. We prove that the quenched correlations of the random dynamical system decays exponentially. 

## 1.  Introduction The Lorenz system was introduced in [30] as a simplified model for atmospheric convection. Numerical simulations have shown that the Lorenz system admits a strange attractor, called the Lorenz attractor, which became one of the most iconic examples in the field. 

A rigorous mathematical approach was developed with the introduction of the so called geometric Lorenz flow by [1, 26], which mimicks simulation of the dynamics of the Lorenz flow, and which has a robust strange attractor under \(C^{1}\)perturbations. Later in [37, 38] it was shown that the actual Lorenz attractor is indeed a singular hyperbolic attractor, further showing that the geometric Lorenz attractor represents the Lorenz attractor well. Moreover, it admits the so called Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure, which is ergodic [11]. Its statistical properties, such as mixing rates, limit theorems and their stability under various perturbations, were studied intensively (see for example, [31, 10, 9, 7, 14, 13, 24]). 

Another class of systems with similar properties was introduced in [35] called the _contracting Lorenz flow_ . A fundamental difference between these is that the attractor of the system introduced by Rovella is not robust under perturbations, but still abundant in a measure theoretic sense. The set of measures for which the system is chaotic is called Rovella parameters and satisfies strong chaotic properties [8]; moreover, restricted to this set the system is stochastically stable [32, 33]. In [34] the authors addressed thermodynamic formalism for it. Up to now, the contracting Lorenz flow and one dimensional maps with critical points remain a profound example of a truly nonuniformly hyperbolic systems, which is studied via construction of induced schemes. We refer to [3] for a comprehensive account of these constructions. 

Recently, there has been increased interest in studying statistical properties of random dynamical systems, especially quenched (path-wise) properties. When the system has good uniformly hyperbolic properties, spectral techniques are still applicable and imply strong statistical properties; we refer to [19, 20, 21, 23, 22] and references therein for results on quenched decay of correlations, limit theorems and stability results in this case. 

For the non-uniformly expanding (or non-uniformly hyperbolic) case, spectral techniques are not applicable directly. In this regards, it is customary to employ inducing techniques, in particular randomised version of Young Tower [39] construction called random Young towers. This was first carried out in [15] for random
