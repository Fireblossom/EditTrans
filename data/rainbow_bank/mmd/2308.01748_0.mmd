##### Abstract
In magnetoconvection, the flow of electromagnetically conductive fluid is driven by a combination of buoyancy forces, which create the fluid motion due to thermal expansion and contraction, and Lorentz forces, which distort the convective flow structure in the presence of a magnetic field. The differences in the global flow structures in the buoyancy-dominated and Lorentz-force-dominated regimes lead to different heat transport properties in these regimes, reflected in distinct dimensionless scaling relations Nu) versus the strength of buoyancy (Rayleigh number
 Ra) and
 Ha). Here, we propose a theoretical model for the transition
 between these two regimes for the case of a quasistatic vertical magnetic field applied to a convective fluid layer confined between two isothermal, a lower warmer and an upper colder, horizontal surfaces. The model suggests that the scaling exponents \(\gamma\)in the buoyancy-dominated regime,
 \(\mbox{\rm{Nu}}\sim\mbox{\rm{Ra}}^{\gamma}\)and
 , and \(\xi\)in the Lorentz-force-dominated regime,
 \(\mbox{\rm{Nu}}\sim(\mbox{\rm{Ha}}^{-2}\mbox{\rm{Ra}})^{\xi}\), are related as \(\xi=\gamma/(1-2\gamma)\)our
 , and the onset
 of the transition scales with
 \(\mbox{\rm{Ha}}^{-1/\gamma}\mbox{\rm{Ra}}\). These theoretical results are supported by our Direct Numerical
 Simulations for
 \(10\leqslant\mbox{\rm{Ha}}\leqslant 2000\), Prandtl number
 \(\mbox{\rm{Pr}}=0.025\)and
 Raup to

Magnetoconvection (MC) governs most astro- and geophysical systems and is relevant to various engineering applications [25, 7]. The former include, for instance, outer layers of stars and liquid metal planetary cores [12], examples of the latter comprise liquid-metal batteries, induction heating, casting, liquid-metal cooling for nuclear fusion reactors and semiconductor crystal growth [6]. MC occurs in an electrically conducting fluid that is subjected both to a magnetic field and an imposed temperature gradient. The buoyancy forces induce convective fluid motion due to thermal expansion and contraction, while the magnetic field affects this motion and distorts the global flow structure through the Lorentz force, which eventually influences the heat transport in the system. The resulting main two control parameters, the strength of the imposed thermal driving and that of the external magnetic field, are encoded in independent dimensionless groups, Raand Hartmann number
 Ha, respectively.
 

One of the key objectives in MC research is to provide scaling relations for the heat transport through the Nu, as a function of
 Raand
 Ha. However,
 the heat transport scaling relations also depend on the flow configuration, including the angle between the magnetic field and gravity, the geometry of the container and the boundary conditions (BCs), and on whether the buoyancy forces dominate over the Lorentz forces in the system or vice versa. This inherent complexity results in the need, at least in principle, to derive separate heat transport scaling relations to describe each specific flow regime itself and transitions between distinct regimes. The considerable difficulty of doing so in a coherent manner is exacerbated by non-universal scaling relations even within specific regimes – the scaling relations in the buoyancy-dominated and Lorentz-force-dominated regimes themselves change with the control parameters, and transitions between the different regimes are also non-universal. 

The objective of this paper is to offer a unifying heat transport model for the transition between the buoyancy-dominated and Lorentz-force-dominated regimes in quasistatic MC.
