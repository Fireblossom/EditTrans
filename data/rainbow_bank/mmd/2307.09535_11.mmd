#### The case of a general periodic force

  Finally, we remark that in the general case of a \(\theta\)-periodic force of the form 

\[{\mathcal{F}}(t/\theta)=\sum_{\ell=1}^{+\infty}F_{\ell}\cos(\omega(\ell)t), \quad\mbox{where }\omega(\ell):=\frac{2\pi\ell}{\theta}\

\[W(n)=\sum_{\ell=1}^{+\infty}\big{(}\omega(\ell)F_{\ell}\big{)}^{2}\frac{N( \omega(\ell),n)}{D(\omega(\ell),n)}.\

### Energy
 

.
  As in Section  3.1  we assume that the periodic force energy
  is given by ( 3.3 ). The time average of the expectation of the total energy energy of the chain \(E(\omega,n)\)and
  breaks up into the sum of thermal component \(E_{\rm th}(\omega,n)=\sum_{x\in{\mathbb{I}}_{n}}\langle\langle e_{x}^{\rm th}\rangle\rangle\)of
 \(e_{x}^{\rm mech}\)and the mechanical one \(E_{\rm mech}(\omega,n)=\sum_{x\in{\mathbb{I}}_{n}}\langle\langle e_{x}^{\rm mech }\rangle\rangle\)sum

Considering the behavior of the thermal energy functional, defined in ( 2.15 ), it has been shown in [ 0 ], that in the case \(\omega_{0}=0\)and
 and
 \(\gamma_{-}=\gamma_{+}\),
  we have in

 As
 \[\langle\langle e_{x}^{\rm th}\rangle\rangle=\frac{1}{2}(T_{-}+T_{+})(1+o_{x}), \quad\mbox{where }|o_{x}|\leqslant\frac{C}{g^{x\wedge(n+1-x)}}\]  constants
