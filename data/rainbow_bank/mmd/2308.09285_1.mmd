### Fingerprint Image Synthesis 

detection methods [  29 ] only focus on coping with presen tation attacks, which construct artificial fingers [ 34 ] to circumvent the fingerprint recognition system. To model the physiological dif ferences between the artificial and real fingers, existing liveness detection methods usually rely on collecting the pulse rate, skin odor, finger elasticity, _ etc._ , from the sensor of the fingerprint recog nition system. Unfortunately, the replacement attack, _ i.e._ , replacing the real fingerprint images with the GAN-generated fingerprint images, usually happens after the fingerprint collection step and the fake fingerprint images are generated without the defects of artificial fingers. Besides, the GAN-generated fingerprint images also exist some generation artifacts, which are induced by specific processing operations in GANs and does not exist in the captured impressions. Under such circumstance, the existing fingerprint live ness detection methods can hardly be directly applied to detect the GAN-generated fingerprint images. 

To efficiently and effectively identify the GAN-generated fin gerprint images with decent robustness against the existing anti forensic method [ 11 ], in this paper, we propose a ** R** obust deep 

Several recent methods have been proposed for generating realistic fingerprint images automatically [  17 ]. [ 3 and [ 35 ] combine a convolution autoencoder (CAE) and a GAN based method ( _e.g._ , DCGAN [ 38 ], WGAN [ 18 ]) directly. [ 4 ] presents a GAN-based pipeline followed by a stochastic search algorithm over the latent variable space, to search for suitable latent variable and generate DeepMasterPrints which are synthetic fingerprints and can be matched against a large number of fingerprints. These techniques can be considered as single-staged architectures, whose input is a random vector and output is a generated image. 

To make the synthetic results more realistic and obtain multiple impressions for a virtual identity, many multi-staged methods [  39 ] firstly synthesize a binary masterprint which defines a ridge structure and represents a new identity. After non linear distortion and cropping, which simulate various pressures and different contact regions between the finger and the fingerprint sensor, the distorted masterprint is fed into another generative neural network to generate a realistic fingerprint image. The differences between these multi-staged methods lie in the way of the master print generation scheme, the distortion simulation method, and the final impression (fingerprint) generation approach. [ 12 ] utilizes the GAN-based methods ( _e.g._ , BigGAN [ 5 ]) in these three steps. [ 17 attempts to employ conventional rotation instead of the deep learning method in the distortion module. [ 39 ] adopts StyleGAN2 [ 22 ] to synthesize the fingerprint skeletons and CycleGAN [ 46 ] to generate photorealistic fingerprint images. [ 44 ] also proposes a CycleGAN based L3 synthetic fingerprint generation (L3-SF) approach, which firstly uses traditional methods ( _e.g._ , Anguli [ 1 ], Gabor filter) to generate masterprints with pores and scratch. Besides, [ 44 ] releases a synthetic fingerprint database. 

**F** orgery ** D** etection method ** for**  GAN-generated ** Fin** gerprint images (RFDforFin). To take full advantage of the fingerprint characteris tics and the generation artifacts of the fake fingerprint images, we construct a lightweight yet robust two-stream neural network, by exploiting the unique features of the fingerprint images and gen eration artifacts in frequency domain. Considering the impact of sweat on grayscale variations along the ridges of fingerprints [ 10 ], we construct a special ridge stream which utilizes this unique fin gerprint characteristic. In the generation artifact stream, inspired by [ 13 ], which discovers the obvious generation artifacts in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) frequency domain, we transform the input fingerprint image into different frequency domains, an alyze the generation artifacts in these spectrum, and construct a simple yet effective convolutional neural network to learn more robust generation artifacts between the generated and real images from the FFT frequency spectrum. To simultaneously utilize the features extracted from the ridges and generation artifacts in the fi nal prediction, we build a simple yet effective fusion module. Since typical CNNs can learn certain frequency information from the input image or its frequency transformed spectrum, by utilizing the unique 1D ridge features jointly with the 2D generation artifact features, our method can avoid overfitting to certain frequency information, which can improve the robustness of our method. 

Our main contributions are summarized as follows: 

### Deep Forgery Detection 


*  We propose the first deep forgery detection method for GAN-generated fingerprint images, by jointly exploiting the unique 1D ridge features and 2D generation artifact features via a lightweight two-stream neural network to ensure the robustness and efficiency of the proposed work. 
*  We propose to exploit fingerprint-related characteristic and construct a ridge stream, which exploits the grayscale varia tions along the ridges. With this ridge stream, our method can avoid overfitting to certain frequency information, which can be easily interfered by existing anti-forensic method [ 11 and thus improves the overall robustness. 

Researchers have proposed a series of deep forgery detection approaches to detect the generated images [ 2  7  13  23  26  31 ]. [ 31 ] reveals that the texture statistics is an important detection clue and global texture features can improve the robustness of face forgery detection. [ 13 ] observes that GAN generated images contain distinguishable artifacts in the frequency domain due to the upsampling operations in the generator of GAN architectures, and these artifacts can be utilized for forgery detec tion. [ 28 ] attempts to explore the discrepancies in Learned Noise Patterns (LNP) to detect forgery. [ 30 ] concatenates spatial images and phase spectrums to emphasize the artifacts and proposes a Spatial-Phase Shallow Learning method. [ 26 ] captures frequency aware features and merge them with the extracted spatial domain
