where \(\rho_{w}\) is the density of water and \(C\) the ocean function that equals one where water is present and zero otherwise. In the case of ice loading, the direct term is given by 

\[\zeta=\rho_{i}(1-C)\Delta I,\] (12)  

where \(\rho_{i}\) is the density of ice, and \(\Delta I\) the change in ice thickness. The factor, \(1-C\), within this expression accounts for the possibility of floating ice (e.g. Crawford et al. 2018, equations 31–34). 

Consider again a pair of solutions \((\mathbf{u},\phi)\) and \((\mathbf{u}^{\dagger},\phi^{\dagger})\) of the loading problem associated, respectively, to with loads \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma^{\dagger}\). Here, however, we assume that these loads are decomposed as in eq.(2.11) into water and direct terms that share a common ocean function. From the above expression for sea level change we can write 

\[\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\Phi+\phi=-g\,\Delta SL+\Phi_{g},\quad\mathbf{u}^{\dagger }\cdot\nabla\Phi+\phi^{\dagger}=-g\,\Delta SL^{\dagger}+\Phi_{g}^{\dagger},\] (13)  

and hence eq.(2.8) becomes 



\[\int_{\partial M}(-g\,\Delta SL^{\dagger}+\Phi^{\dagger}_{g})\,\sigma\,\mathrm {d}S=\int_{\partial M}(-g\,\Delta SL+\Phi_{g})\,\sigma^{\dagger}\,\mathrm{d}S.\] (14)  

The terms involving the constants \(\Phi_{g}\) and \(\Phi_{g}^{\dagger}\)vanish due to conservation of mass, and so the identity simplifies to 



\[\int_{\partial M}\Delta SL^{\dagger}\,\sigma\,\mathrm{d}S=\int_{\partial M} \Delta SL\,\sigma^{\dagger}\,\mathrm{d}S.\] (15)  

If we now substitute into the equality the decompositions of the loads, \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma^{\dagger}\), we find 



\[\int_{\partial M}\Delta SL^{\dagger}(\rho_{w}C\,\Delta SL+\zeta)\,\,\mathrm{d} S=\int_{\partial M}\Delta SL\,(\rho_{w}C\,\Delta SL^{\dagger}+\zeta^{\dagger}) \,\mathrm{d}S,\] (16)  

and cancelling the terms symmetric in \(\Delta SL\) and \(\Delta SL^{\dagger}\)we arrive at 



\[\int_{\partial M}\Delta SL^{\dagger}\,\zeta\,\,\mathrm{d}S=\int_{\partial M} \Delta SL\,\zeta^{\dagger}\,\mathrm{d}S.\] (17)  

Again, this is a known result, being implied as a special case by the adjoint theory of Crawford et al. (2018) for sea level change in a viscoelastic earth model. What is new is the explicit statement as a reciprocity theorem along with the more elementary derivation that has been facilitated by restricting attention to the elastic fingerprint problem. 

### Symmetry of the Green’s function 

Because the fingerprint problem is linear, its solution must take the form 



\[\Delta SL(\mathbf{x})=\int_{\partial M}G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}^{\prime})\zeta( \mathbf{x}^{\prime})\,\mathrm{d}S_{\mathbf{x}^{\prime}},\] (18)  

for an appropriate Green’s function, where we have added a subscript to the surface element to make clear which variable it is defined with respect to. Suppose that, within eq.(2.17), we take
