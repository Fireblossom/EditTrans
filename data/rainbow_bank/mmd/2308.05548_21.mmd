Such that the overall problem can be set up with the following function: 

#### Runtime Analysis 

For the runtime analysis, the idea is to Â´ run the sensor network localization problem with varying number of sensors both with a decentral and a central optimization step. To do so, firstly a vector with a number of sensors is needed and secondly a vector with variances. Then, the time needed for the decentral and the central optimization is measured and can be plotted.
