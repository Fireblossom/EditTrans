## Checking SUSY for the Fibered Background 

Here we aim to compute how many supercharges are preserved by the the backgrounds presented in this paper. For the un-fibered background in eq.( 2.1 ) we refer the reader to [ 12 ], [ 19 ], where it is shown that this solution preserves 16 Supercharges in an interesting way: the anti-commutator of two supercharges includes the \(R\)-Symmetry generators. Now we present the analysis for the fibered background in eq.( 2.3 ). We perform all the analysis in the S-dual system, in terms of NS5 branes, where we only have \(H_{3}\) flux. 

First, note that the dilatino variation is a matrix equation of the form \(M\varepsilon=0\). In order to have
 non-trivial solutions to this equation, we require \(M\) to be non-invertible, for which we need to impose \(\text{det}(M)=0\). It is also possible to obtain a matrix equation from the gravitino variation. Noting that
 we can write the gravitino variation as a covariant derivative, for which we define the connection 

\[W_{\mu}=\frac{1}{4}\omega^{\phantom{\mu}ab}_{\mu}\Gamma_{ab}+\frac{1}{4\cdot 2 !}H_{\mu\nu\lambda}\Gamma^{\nu\lambda}\sigma^{3}+\frac{e^{\Phi}}{8}\left(F_{ \mu}\Gamma^{\mu}(i\sigma_{2})+\frac{1}{3!}F_{\mu\nu\lambda}\Gamma^{\mu\nu \lambda}\sigma^{1}+\frac{1}{2\cdot 5!}F_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho\sigma}\Gamma^{\mu \nu\lambda\rho\sigma}(i\sigma_{2})\right)\Gamma_{\mu},\  

then we can write the gravitino variation as 

\[\delta\psi_{\mu}dx^{\mu}=\left(\partial_{\mu}\varepsilon+W_{\mu}\varepsilon \right)dx^{\mu}\equiv\mathcal{D}\varepsilon.\  

We can get rid of the partial derivative of the spinor by acting with \(\mathcal{D}\) a second time 

\[\mathcal{D}\wedge\mathcal{D}\varepsilon=\left(dW+W\wedge W\right)\varepsilon= \frac{1}{2}\Theta_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}\wedge dx^{\nu}\varepsilon.\  

Each of the components of
 \(\Theta_{\mu\nu}\)\(\Theta_{\mu\nu}\)Each of the components of Θµν defines a matrix equation, giving a total of 45 independent equations. We need to make sure that det(Θµν) = 0 for each of the components. The equations
 \(\text{det}(\Theta_{\mu\nu})=0\)for each of the components. The equations
 for each of the components. The equations
 

\[M\varepsilon=0,\quad\Theta_{\mu\nu}\varepsilon=0,\  

constrain the number of independent components of the spinor. After this procedure we use the gravitino variation to solve the dependence of the spinor on the spacetime coordinates. 

Specialising to our background, the determinant of the Dilatino variation for the background in eq.( 2.3 ) reads 

\[\text{det}(M)\sim\left(4(e_{B}Q_{A}-e_{A}Q_{B})^{2}+m^{2}\right)^{8}\left(4(e_ {B}Q_{A}+e_{A}Q_{B})^{2}+m^{2}\right)^{8}.\

conditions
 



In order to have non-trivial solutions we need to impose the following BPS conditions on the parameters of the background 

\[e_{A}Q_{B}=\pm e_{B}Q_{A},\quad m=0.\  

With this conditions it is possible to check that
 \(\text{det}(\Theta_{\mu\nu})=0\)is also satisfied. Solving these matrix
 equations shows that the spinor has 8 independent components. Then, solving for the gravitino variation shows that these components are not independents, and in fact, the total number of independent components its reduced to 4. The solution for the spinor is 

\[\varepsilon_{1}=\vec{0}\
