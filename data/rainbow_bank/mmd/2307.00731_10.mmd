of \(10^{3}\)G (Reiners & Christensen 2010), we get a magnetic field strength of 4.5 \(\times 10^{1}\)G at the eclipse edge ( \(\phi_{b}=0.31\)). A magnetosphere field strength of 10 G is sufficient to trap and dominate plasma (assuming protons and electrons) of number density \(<3\times 10^{13}\)cm _-3_and velocity \(\sim V_{\rm orb}\). 

Thompson et al. (1994) suggests that, at the edge of the magnetosphere of the brown dwarf, the magnetic pressure should balance the pulsar wind pressure, while the pulsar wind energy density is \(U_{E}=\frac{\dot{E}}{4{\pi}ca^{2}}\) and the magnetic pressure is \(\frac{B_{E}^{2}}{8{\pi}}\). The \(\dot{E}\)\(\dot{E}\) is the spin-down luminosity, c is the speed of light, \(a\) is the orbital separation, and \(B_{E}\) is the magnetic field of the eclipse medium. From this, the magnetic field strength of \(B_{E}\) should be \(\approx 8~{}\).
 

Interestingly, the derived theoretical magnetic field strength (45 G) is more than sufficient for the re- quired field strength (8 G) at the eclipsing edge. However, these field strengths are more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value observed in our egress (10 mG). 

### Pulsar wind 

The third scenario (Fig. 7 c) supplements the second one with pulsar wind and a shock boundary, and fixes the inconsistency mentioned above. Such a picture was proposed by Phinney et al. (1988) as one of the early models. In this picture, a shock boundary exists between the magnetosphere and the pulsar wind. Outside of the shock boundary are high-speed, low-density pulsar wind particles traveling with a low magnetic field, and inside, the slow-moving, high-density plasma trapped by the companion’s magnetic fields. This is similar to the boundary shock observed from the Solar wind and the Earth magnetosphere (Sckopke et al. 1983) where both the electron density and magnetic field rose suddenly as the ISEE-1 8 probe traveled downstream of the Solar wind into the Earth magnetosphere. 

The majority of energy in the pulsar wind is carried by relativistic particles. The magnetic fields in the pulsar wind could be much smaller than the magnetic field of the companion at the orbital distance. After all, the pulsar’s magnetic field is only 1.6 \(\times 10^{8}\)G at its 10 km radius surface (Tab. 1). The pulsar wind is almost transparent to the pulsar emission. This is because of the low density and the high Lorenz factor of the wind particles. The wind particles have motion masses far exceeding their rest masses, causing their Faraday rotation effect to be negligible (Quataert & Gruzinov 2000; Wang et al. 2011). When a moderate amount of slow-moving ionized materials from the companion’s magnetosphere flow out of the boundary and come to the pulsar wind side, the combination of the extra slow electrons and a reasonably low magnetic field (10 mG) environment leads to the incomplete depolarization and the Faraday rotation. As we mentioned in the previous section, such a condition is rarely met (only be observed in MJD 59214). In most of the ingresses and egresses of this pulsar, the out-flowing electrons are either too dense or too variable and often completely depolarize the pulsar signal. 

Thompson et al. (1994) predicted that the pulsar wind could contain an oscillating part around the eclipsing edge with an oscillation length of \(cP/2\simeq 500\) km, where \(c\) is the speed of light and \(P\) is the spin period of the pulsar. It should be noted that such reciprocating magnetic fields in the pulsar wind was already illustrated in the model of Phinney et al. (1988). But such field was never observed until now.
