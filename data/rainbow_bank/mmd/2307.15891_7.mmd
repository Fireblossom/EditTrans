Recently, in [14], Ko  lodziejczyk proved that 2-dimensional polyhedra whose fundamental groups are elementary amenable with finite cohomological dimension have finite depth. In the sequel, we are going to present upper bounds for such polyhedra. 

Recall that if \(P\) is a polyhedron of dimension \(n\), then \(H_{n}(P)\)is free abelian (see,
 for example, [18, Theorem 7.24]). Now we state our second main result.

_Proof._  Consider the following chain of CW-complexes:

_ If_ \(P\)_ is a 2-dimensional polyhedron and_ \(sl(\pi_{1}(P))<\infty\)_, then_ \(D(P)\leq sl\big{(}\pi_{1}(P)\big{)}+rank\big{(}H_{2}(P)\big{)}\)

\[\cdots<X_{i+1}<X_{i}<\cdots<X_{3}<X_{2}<X_{1}<X_{0}=P.\]  Let \(d_{X_{i+1}}:X_{i}\to X_{i+1}\)converse
  and \(u_{X_{i+1}}:X_{i+1}\to X_{i}\) be the domination of \(X_{i}\) over \(X_{i+1}\) and the converse map, i.e., \(d_{X_{i+1}}u_{X_{i+1}}\simeq id_{X_{i+1}}\). Then \(\pi_{1}(d_{X_{i+1}})\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})=id_{\pi_{1}(X_{i+1})}\) and \(H_{2}(d_{X_{i+1}})H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})=id_{H_{2}(X_{i+1})}\). As a result,
 \({\rm im}\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})\)and
 \({\rm im}H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})\)are retracts of
 \(\pi_{1}(X_{i})\)and
 \(H_{2}(X_{i})\).
 

Assume that
 \({\rm im}\big{(}\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}=\pi_{1}(X_{i})\)and
 \({\rm im}\big{(}H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}=H_{2}(X_{i})\). Then
 \(\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})\)and
 \(H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})\)are isomorphisms. Accordingly,
 \(\pi_{1}(d_{X_{i+1}})\)and
 \(H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})\)are isomorphisms. Accordingly,
 \(\pi_{1}(d_{X_{i+1}})\)π1(uXi+1) and H2(uXi+1) are isomorphisms. Accordingly, π1(dXi+1) is an isomorphism and H2(Xi) ∼
= H2(Xi+1). since π1(Xi) ∼
= π1(Xi+1), we have H1(Xi) ∼
=
 \(H_{2}(X_{i})\cong H_{2}(X_{i+1})\). since
 \(\pi_{1}(X_{i})\cong\pi_{1}(X_{i+1})\), we have
 \(H_{1}(X_{i})\cong H_{1}(X_{i+1})\)\(H_{2}(X_{i})\cong H_{2}(X_{i+1})\). since
 \(\pi_{1}(X_{i})\cong\pi_{1}(X_{i+1})\), we have
 \(H_{1}(X_{i})\cong H_{1}(X_{i+1})\)_ _ by the Hurewicz Theorem (see
 ).
 This fact and is a proper retract of \(H_{2}(X_{i})\).
 \(H_{2}(X_{i})\cong H_{2}(X_{i+1})\)imply that
 \(\chi(X_{i})=\chi(X_{i+1})\), where
 \(\chi(X)\)imply that
 \(\chi(X_{i})=\chi(X_{i+1})\), where
 \(\chi(X)\)H2(Xi) ∼
= H2(Xi+1) imply that χ(Xi) = χ(Xi+1), where χ(X) denotes the EulerPoincare characteristic of polyhedron X of dimension m.
Now since dXi+1 :
 \(X\)of dimension
 \(m\).
Now since
 \(d_{X_{i+1}}:X_{i}\to X_{i+1}\)\(X\) of dimension \(m\). Now since \(d_{X_{i+1}}:X_{i}\to X_{i+1}\) is a homotopy domination between \(X_{i}\) and \(X_{i+1}\) that induces an isomorphism on the fundamental groups, it is a homotopy equivalence (by [14, Theorems 2]) which contradicts \(X_{i+1}<X_{i}\). Therefore, either
 \({\rm im}\big{(}\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}\).
 is a proper retract of \(\pi_{1}(X_{i})\)or
 \({\rm im}\big{(}H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}\), So by Lemma 3.3, \(sl\Big{(}{\rm im}\big{(}\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}\Big{)}<sl\big{(}\pi_{1}(X_ {i})\big{)}\)\(\pi_{1}(X_{i+1})\cong{\rm im}\big{(}\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}\)or \(rank\Big{(}{\rm im}\big{(}H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}\Big{)}<rank\big{(}H_{2}(X_ {i})\big{)}\)have
 . Since \(\pi_{1}(X_{i+1})\cong{\rm im}\big{(}\pi_{1}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}\)and \(H_{2}(X_{i+1})\cong{\rm im}\big{(}H_{2}(u_{X_{i+1}})\big{)}\), we have \(sl(\pi_{1}(X_{i_{0}}))=0\)we have by Lemma 3.4 that \(sl\big{(}\pi_{1}(X_{i+1})\big{)}<sl\big{(}\pi_{1}(X_{i})\big{)}\)or \(rank\big{(}H_{2}(X_{i+1})\big{)}<rank\big{(}H_{2}(X_{i})\big{)}\)\(sl(\pi_{1}(X_{i_{0}}))=0\). Thus for \(i_{0}:=sl\big{(}\pi_{1}(P)\big{)}+rank\big{(}H_{2}(P)\big{)}\)Lemma
 and \(rank(H_{2}(X_{i_{0}}))=0\)which means by Lemma
 that
 \(\pi_{1}(X_{i_{0}})=1\)and
 \(H_{2}(X_{i_{0}})=0\), Hence,
 \(X_{i_{0}}\) is homotopically trivial and so the proof is finished.
