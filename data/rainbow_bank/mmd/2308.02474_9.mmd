In Figure 9, we show the Leavitt laws for a sample of Cepheids in the LMC (Persson et al. 2004) and in NGC 7250 (Owens et al. 2023). The scatter in the _ JWST_  F115W data for NGC 7250 is a factor of two smaller than in the SHoES F160W data; i.e., the improved resolution and higher signal-to-noise ratio of the _ JWST_  data results in a lower variance ( \(\sigma^{2}\)) for the F115W relation by almost a factor of four. This is all the more remarkable since the \(J\)-band data are single-phase observations only, while the _ HST_  observations have been corrected to mean light. The _ HST_  data exhibit more than three times the scatter of the \(H\)-band data for the LMC, the latter of which reflects the expected scatter for that band, as exemplified by the LMC data. 

## 12.  SUMMARY 

The accuracy of the Cepheid distance scale has continued to improve over the century during which it has been used to measure the distances to nearby galaxies and set the scale for the determination of H â‚€. Still, challenges remain in overcoming systematic uncertainties. Many of these challenges will be overcome with new capabilities provided by the _JWST_ . 

New _ JWST_  data for the nearby galaxy NGC 7250 already demonstrate that (1) many of the Cepheids observed with _HST/WFC3_  are significantly crowded (and biased to brighter apparent magnitudes) by nearby neighbors. A re-analysis of the SH0ES optical data, then coupled with the new high-resolution and higher signal-to-noise _ JWST_  F115W data, leads to significantly reduced effects of crowding and smaller photometric uncertainties. (2) These improvements result in a factor of two lower scatter in the near-infrared Leavitt law for _ JWST_  F115W compared with _ HST_  F160W, even with single-epoch F115W _ JWST_  photometry. 

The galaxies in our _ JWST_  CCHP program sample have all been selected to have with distances \(\lesssim\)20 Mpc, close enough to minimize crowding effects. As for the case of NGC 7250 presented here, these data will be combined with a re-analysis of the SH0ES _ HST_  optical data for the Cepheids. TRGB, carbon star, and Cepheid distances to the same sample of galaxies being observed as part of the CCHP will allow measurement of three independent distances to each 

**Figure 8.**  Four Cepheids in NGC 7250 discovered as part of the SH0ES project (bottom row: _ HST_  F160W/ \(H\)-band exposures; top row: _ JWST_  F115W/ \(J\)band). Each postage-stamp image is
 \(2\times 2\)arcsec on a side. The red circles are centered at the
 position of the Cepheid determined from the _ HST_  optical (F350LP white light) photometry. It is immediately evident that the crowding for these Cepheids is quite severe and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the \(H\)-band data tends to be low, ranging from 1 to 23. In contrast, the SNR for the \(J\)-band data ranges from 36 to 121. On average, the _ JWST_  data have almost an order of magnitude greater SNR, and a four times better angular resolution, allowing the Cepheids to be distinguished clearly from the background.
