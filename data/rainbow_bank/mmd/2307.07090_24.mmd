though our model exhibits a larger variance in the estimated elasticity values compared to the BLP model. 

We further estimate the average own-elasticity for high-priced, medium-priced, and lowpriced cars and construct a confidence interval for each category using our inference procedure. We present our result in Table  14 . 

## Conclusion Choice models are fundamental in understanding consumer behavior and informing business decisions. Over the years, various methods, both parametric and non-parametric, have been developed to represent consumer behavior. While parametric methods, such as logit or probit-based models, are favored for their simplicity and interpretability, their restrictive assumptions can limit their ability to fully capture consumer preferences’ intricacies. On the other hand, non-parametric methods offer a more flexible approach, but they often suffer from the “curse of dimensionality”, where the complexity of estimating choice functions escalates exponentially with an increase in the number of products. 

In this paper, we propose a fundamental characterization of choice models that combines the tractability of traditional choice models and the flexibility of non-parametric estimators. This characterization specifically tackles the challenge of high dimensionality in choice systems and facilitates flexible estimation of choice functions. Through extensive simulations, we validate the efficacy of our model, demonstrating its superior ability to capture a range of consumer behaviors that traditional choice models fail to capture. We also show how to
