some additional components are added to the matter distribution due to which the number of unknowns grow that make more challenging to solve the Einstein field equations analytically. In this regard, such analytical solutions developed via gravitational decoupling (GD) with minimal geometric deformation (MGD) method in both cosmology and astrophysics [21, 22]. 

Multiple methods studied to investigate important properties of self-gravitating objects, including the phenomenon of stability and hydrodynamic equilibrium, the upper limit of the mass-to-radius ratio, the upper limit of superficial redshift, and dynamics of matter content under energy conditions, etc. [23]. One of these techniques is MGD approach, which was initially intended as an optional means of deforming Schwarzschild space-time in framework of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld [24, 25]. Recently, there is a lot of interest in developing novel analytic and an anisotropic solutions for Einstein field equations, which is a difficult task as Einstein field equations are non-linear and difficult to handle. In this way, the method of MGD to gain new models representing relativistic objects with well-determined characteristics have been proposed [26]. For a compact spherical distribution, the analytical solution of an anisotropic fluid as well as the braneworld model of Tolman IV solution have been found [27]. Two essential components are required in which first one is dimensionless coupling constant
 \(``\alpha"\)to incorporate an extra source
 into the stress-energy tensor of seed solution. Second one is MGD method on the metric potentials (often on the radial component of metric) in the context of braneworld model. If the seed solution is assumed to be anisotropic, the inclusion of this additional component combined with a static and spherically-symmetric system gives rise to a complex simultaneous equations. The MGD technique separates Einstein field equations into two systems, namely the “Einstein system” and “quasi-Einstein system”, which in comparison to the original system are easy to solve. At this point, a few observations are appropriate, firstly, the decoupled systems satisfy Bianchi Identities and secondly, the extra source may be a scalar, vector, or tensor field [28–32]. Moreover, a number of interesting results on the solutions of black hole with 2+1 and 3+1 decomposition obtained in [33–36]. Additionally, the solutions of new hairy black hole have just been explored [37], and a mechanism is created as well to turn any non-rotational black hole into a rotational one [38, 39]. 

When weak gravitational forces are at work, the hypothesis in GR has effectively aligned with many tests carried out within the solar system, demonstrating its success in cosmology. To get more accurate and dependable results, this theory may need to be modified when dealing with high gravitational fields or while being observed on a big scale. These changes may be very important in explaining the phenomena of accelerated expansion. These modifications are termed as modified theories (see, for instance [40–47]) 

Many modified theories of gravity [48–52] are taken into account by changing the Einstein-Hilbert action that is frequently used to study both the existence of dark energy and dark matter as well as the mystery of universe rapid expansion. Geometrical representation and scalar tensor representation of \(f(G,T)\)gravity has been presented to
 establish novel junction condition [53]. 

Several researchers are interested to explore the gravitational collapse phenomena because it is a prominent case in a strong-field regime [54–56]. Jordan [57] developed a full gravitational theory which gave the title of a gravitational scalar field to gravitational constant. Brans and Dicke [58] developed a scalar-tensor field theory named as the BransDicke (BD) theory obtained by substituting a time modifying constant G(t) and with the help of a scalar field (Φ)
 \(G(t)\)and with the help of a scalar field
 \((\Phi)\)\(G(t)\)and with the help of a scalar field
 \((\Phi)\)having interaction along with the geometry. Additionally, the well-known scalar field coupling constant or parameter ( \(\omega_{BD}\)) of the BD theory is a constant that can be adjusted to get the desired outcomes in Jordan frame. It is assumed \(\Phi\)is reciprocal of the dynamical gravitational constant, i.e.,
 \(G(t)=\frac{1}{\Phi(t)}\). The test particles travel along geodesics according to the BD theory, they consequently obey the weak equivalence principle, which states that the gravitational mass and inertial mass are equivalent. Mach principle, agreement with the weak equivalence principle, and Dirac’s large number hypothesis are the main ingredients of the BD theory. This theory includes a metric tensor and a scalar field that describes gravity. 

\(\Phi\)describes the fast expansion of the universe, is found by recent study in cosmology, including
 the redshift and distance-luminosity connection of type Ia Supernovae [59]. The evidence for various cosmic concerns, including the late behavior of the universe, cosmic acceleration, and the inflation issue, etc are also supported by the BD theory [60]. This theory has drawn interest in recent years due to its precision in describing early inflationary era and late time expansion of the cosmos. Several authors studied the Friedmann-Lemaˆ ıtre-Robertson-Walker model in the context of the BD theory [61–63]. 

The main purpose of this work is to extend [64] in the BD theory. The paper is organized as follows. The appropriate BD theory for the GD formalism is discussed in Sec. II. In Sec. III, the MGD technique to a spherically symmetric geometry filled with two sources in the BD theory is introduced. In Sec. IV, junction conditions are established to match an outside Schwarzschild line element with the inside solution. In Sec. V, we studied mathematical and physical solutions to the modified field equations using the MGD method with constraints apply to matter density and radial pressure for anisotropy in the setting of the BD theory. In Sec. VI, the physical characteristics of an anisotropic stellar structure with the help of polytropic equation of state are provided. The main results are summarized in Sec. VII.
