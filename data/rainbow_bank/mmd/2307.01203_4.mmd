to accept a trigger of  40 ns  and an integration time of  325 ns  to collect photons on the sensor tile. The overvoltage of the silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) is set to  3 V . As this is a digital tile it is possible to disable the SPADs which produce a high number of dark counts. This inhibit fraction is set to  10 % . The surface of each sensor tile is covered with a glass plate of  1 _._ 1 mm . The sensor tiles are connected to a singles processing unit (SPU) which manages their voltage supply and feeds their data to the data acquisition and processing server (DAPS). During the measurement, the tiles are cooled by a  15 _◦_ C  liquid cooling system. 

#### 2.1.3. Masks 

We perform measurements in one and two dimensions, i.e., we reconstruct an image along one axis or on a plane. For these two tasks, we use a one- and a two-dimensional versions of a MURA mask of rank 476, clipped to \($31$\times$31$\)central pixels (see Fig. 2). The mask rank as well as the setup geometry
 have been optimised via Monte Carlo simulations before the experiment. To construct the physical masks we use tungsten rods of \(($2.26$\times$2.26$\times$20$)\,${\mathrm{mm}}^{3}\text{/}$\)which are inserted into 3D printed rasters made from Pro Grey Resin. The
 rod manufacturing reaches a precision of  0 _._ 1 mm . The resulting masks have a dimension of \(($73.6$\times$73.6$)\,${\mathrm{mm}}^{2}\text{/}$\). The rasters have a total thickness of  13 mm  and the holes to insert the rods are
  10 mm  deep. To prevent the rods from falling out, the assembled masks are wrapped in cling film. 

### 2.2. Radioactive sources ²²Na source with an activity of 2.89 MBq.
The active material in
 ²²Na source with an activity of  2 _._ 89 MBq . The active material in that source covers an area of \($1\text{\,}\mathrm{mm}\text{/}$\times$1\text{\,}\mathrm{mm}\text{/}$\). As a \(\beta^{+}\)-emitter, ²²Na provides two photons of  511 keV emitted back-to-back, which can be used for electronic
 collimation. For calibration of the detectors we additionally used the  1275 keV gamma line of ²²Na and two more radioactive sources: a ¹³⁷Cs source with a gamma line at  662 keV  with an activity of  1 _._ 73 MBq  and a ¹³³Ba source with
