_Proof._ We first present two natural choices for a negative cycle, one of length
 \(2k\)and another of length
 \(2l\). The first is a negative cycle on the first two layers. Take a positive edge and connect its two ends with one of the two paths using only the negative edges that connect the two layers. This would result in a negative cycle of length
 \(2k\). The second negative cycle we consider is by taking a positive edge and connecting each of its ends to the vertex \(u\) by a shortest path (all edges negative). One of these paths will be of length \(l\)and the other would be of length \(l-1\). Together with the first chosen edge itself then, they form a negative
 cycle of length
 \(2l\). 

It remains to show that the shortest of these two types of cycles gives us the negative girth. To that end, we will first show that a shortest negative cycle can only use one positive edge of \(\widehat{BQ}(\ell,2k-1)\)e aim
come
 \(\widehat{BQ}(\ell,2k-1)\)present
 . Towards
 a contradiction, let \(C\) be a negative cycle with more than two positive edges. We aim to present a negative cycle \(C^{\prime}\)whose length is at most \(|C|-2\). We take two positive edges of
 \(C\) that come consecutively on the cyclic order. Assume \(xy\) and \(x^{\prime}y^{\prime}\)are these two edges and that \(x^{\prime}\)is followed by \(y\) in the cyclic order of \(C\)(that is to say, there is no positive edge in the \(x^{\prime}-y\)but
  path in \(C\)). We remove the two positive edges \(xy\)and \(x^{\prime}y^{\prime}\)and the \(x^{\prime}y\) path connecting them in \(C\), but then we add a \(xy^{\prime}\)copy of this path (which also has no positive edge). The result is a closed walk whose sign is the same as that of \(C\), and whose length is \(|C|-2\)a
 . But then this closed walk must contain a negative cycle, whose length then is also at most
 \(|C|-2\),
 a contradiction.
