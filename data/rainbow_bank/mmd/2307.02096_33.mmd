## Appendix B. Derivation of  E 1 VV [âˆ† H ]  in  (19) According to [8], for the harmonic oscillator with the Hamiltonian (A.1) and the equations of motion (A.2), the expected energy error produced by a \(k\)-stage palindromic splitting integrator \(\Psi_{h}\) applied for \(L\) integration steps is given by 

\[\mathbb{E}[\Delta H]=\sin^{2}\left(L\Theta^{\bm{z}}_{h}\right)\rho(h,\bm{z}),\] (43)  

where \(\Theta^{\bm{z}}_{h}=\arccos A^{\bm{z}}_{h}\), and \(A^{\bm{z}}_{h}\). For
 \(L=1\) and \(\rho(h,\bm{z})\)defined in (A.4), (B.1) yields 

\[\mathbb{E}[\Delta H]=\frac{\left(B^{\bm{z}}_{h}+C^{\bm{z}}_{h}\right)^{2}}{2}.\] (44)  

Figure 14: Musk BLR: The effect of the scaling approaches \(S\) and \(S_{\omega}\) (28) with (30) (in green) and with (29) (in purple) respectively. Metrics are plotted against the 1-stage dimensionless stability interval \((0,2)\) for comparison. Using \(S_{\omega}\) (in purple) helps to shift the best performance of both adaptive schemes towards the center of the stability interval. Moreover, \(\max\text{PSRF}\)confirms that the stability limit is estimated better with
 \(S_{\omega}\).
