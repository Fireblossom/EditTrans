# Introduction 

Vectorlike (VL) fermions are key ingredients in many new physics models beyond the Standard Model (SM) adopted to resolve both theoretical and experimental issues. Since chiral fermions in the fourth family are excluded experimentally [1, 2], these are considered to be vectorlike and their masses are given independently to the Higgs mechanism in the SM. The VL fermions are introduced in, for instance, supersymmetric models [3–10], gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario [11–16], composite Higgs models [17–19], KSVZ axion models [20,21], axionlike particle models [22–25], alternative solutions of the strong CP problem [26,27], two Higgs doublet model augmented by VL fermions [28–38], and models for gauge coupling unification [39,40]. 

Among the fourth family fermions, VL leptons (VLLs) with nonzero lepton number play unique roles in constructing lepton-philic dark matter (DM) models [41–46], mirror sector models [47–49], and explanations for the muon anomalies [50–65] 1 . Interestingly, the lightest VLL is expected to be in the reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) or High-Luminosity (HL)-LHC. Both ATLAS and CMS collaborations search for the pair production of VLLs each of which dominantly decays to a SM boson and a tau lepton [70–72]. For the doublet VLL 2 , the ATLAS search excludes the mass range of
 \(130<m_{\mathrm{VLL}}<900~{}\mathrm{GeV}\)[72], and the CMS search
 excludes the mass up to 1045 GeV [71]. The singlet VLL is less constrained and the limit is less \(150~{}\mathrm{GeV}\)[71]. Prospects of such VLLs at the future colliders are discussed in Ref. [73].
 The pair productions of the VLLs decaying to a SM boson and a muon (neutrino) are studied by the ATLAS [74] and the theorists [75, 76] using the Run-I data. The limit is obtained for \(m_{\rm VLL}\lesssim 500\)GeV when the neutral component of the lightest doublet VLL dominantly decays
 to a \(W\) boson and a muon [75]. There are also studies for the VLL produced from cascade decays of extra neutral Higgs bosons [28–31,35,36], and signals from the VLLs decaying to a DM particle [77] or \(Z^{\prime}\)boson [78]. 

In this paper, we study pair-productions of the VLLs, through the Drell-Yan process, decaying to the second generation lepton, namely _ muon-philic_  VLL. Such VLL is well motivated to explain the experimental anomalies in the muon \(g-2\)limits
 [69, 79, 80] and the semi-leptonic
 \(B\)decays [81]. 3 In this work, we obtain the current limits using the Run-2 data at
 _ _ \(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV by simply recasting the ATLAS analyses searching for the triplet lepton in the type-III seesaw [84,85]. We then estimate expected sensitivities at the HL-LHC using the same channels. 

This paper is organized as follows. We briefly explain the VLLs in Sec. 2 and discuss the analysis strategy in Sec. 3. Our main results are shown in Sec. 4. Finally, we summarize the paper in Sec. 5. 1 The latest experimental result [66] confirms the previous results [67,68] which might deviate from the SM prediction [69]. 2 Throughout this work, doublet (singlet) for VLL means iso-doublet (iso-singlet) under the \(SU(2)_{L}\) gauge symmetry. 3 The LHCb has recently announced the new result of \(R_{K^{(*)}}\) consistent with the SM expectation [82] which requires efforts such as separate measurements of the branching ratio at Belle-II [83].
