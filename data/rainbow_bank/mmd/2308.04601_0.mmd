## 1.  Introduction 

The (logarithmic) Mahler measure of a non-zero rational function \(P\in\mathbb{C}\left(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\right)^{*}\)is defined by 

(1) \[\mathrm{m}\left(P\right)=\mathrm{m}(P(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})):=\frac{1}{\left(2\pi i \right)^{n}}\int_{\mathbb{T}^{n}}\log|P\left(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\right)|\frac{dx _{1}}{x_{1}}\cdots\frac{dx_{n}}{x_{n}},\]  

where \(\mathbb{T}^{n}=\{\left(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\right)\in\mathbb{C}^{*}\times\mathbb{ C}^{*}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{C}^{*}:|x_{1}|=\cdots=|x_{n}|=1\}\)

The first appearance of this quantity (for one variable polynomials) can be traced back to Lehmer’s work [1] on Mersenne numbers, and its several variable form first appeared in the work of Mahler [2] regarding a simpler proof of the Gel’fond-Mahler inequality, and it was later named after him. 

In the early \(80\)’s, Smyth [3] discovered the following remarkable identities: 

\[\mathrm{m}(x+y+1)= \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4\pi}L(\chi_{-3},2),\] \[\mathrm{m}(1+x+y+z)= \frac{7}{2\pi^{2}}\zeta(3),\]  

where \(L(\chi_{-3},2)\) is the Dirichlet \(L\)-function of the quadratic character \(\chi_{-3}\) of conductor \(3,\)and \(\zeta(s)\) is the Riemann zeta function (for more details see [4]). These are two of the initial formulas for several variable cases. 

Later the work of Boyd [5], Deninger [6], Rodriguez-Villeags [7] and others provided us with interesting connections among Mahler measure, higher regulators, and Be˘ ılinson’s conjectures. The conjectural formulas to support their work, such as 

\[\mathrm{m}(P_{k}(x,y))\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}r_{k}L^{\prime}(E_{N(k)}, 0),\quad\quad r_{k}\in\mathbb{Q},\]  

were eventually proved for certain polynomials, due to Rodriguez-Villegas [7], Rogers and Zudilin [8, 9] et al. Here \(E_{N(k)}\) is an elliptic curve of conductor \(N(k)\) associated to \(P_{k},\) and the question mark stands for a numerical formula that is true for at least 20 decimal places. (See the book of Brunault and Zudilin [10] for more details.) 

In a different direction, Cassaigne and Maillot [11] generalized the formula found by Smyth to \(\mathrm{m}(a+bx+cy)\) for arbitrary complex constants \(a,b,\ \mbox{and}\ c:\)

(2) \[\pi\mathrm{m}(ax+by+c)=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}\alpha\log|a|+\beta\log|b|+ \gamma\log|c|+D\left(\frac{|a|}{|b|}e^{i\gamma}\right)&\mbox{if}\ \Delta\ \mbox{holds},\\ \log\max\{|a|,|b|,|c|\}&\mbox{if}\ \Delta\ \mbox{does not hold},\end{array}\right.\]  

where \(\Delta\)stands for the statement that \(|a|,|b|,\ \mbox{and}\ |c|\)angles
  are the lengths of the sides of a planar triangle, and in that case, \(\alpha,\beta,\ \mbox{and}\ \gamma\) are the angles opposite to the sides of the lengths \(|a|,|b|\)

 and \(|c|\)).
 

We also remark that the constant coefficient can be replaced by a variable without changing the Mahler measure, in the sense that \(\mathrm{m}(ax+by+c)=\mathrm{m}(ax+by+cz).\) Additionally, it is
