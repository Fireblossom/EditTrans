 1.5. The control group. We refer to [8] for a discussion about this section. Consider Γ ⊂PSL(3, C) a (discrete or not) subgroup which acts on P2
C with a point p
 \(\Gamma\subset{\rm PSL}(3,\mathbb{C})\)a (discrete or not) subgroup which acts on
 \({\mathbb{P}}_{\mathbb{C}}^{2}\)with a point
 is
 a (discrete or not) subgroup which acts on
 \({\mathbb{P}}_{\mathbb{C}}^{2}\)with a point \(p\)\(\Gamma\). Choose an arbitrary line
 \(\ell\)in \({\mathbb{P}}_{\mathbb{C}}^{2}\setminus\{p\}\), and notice we have a canonical projection: \[\pi=\pi_{p,\ell}:\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}\setminus\{p\}\longrightarrow\ell\,,\]  given by \(\pi(x)=\overleftrightarrow{x,p}\cap\ell\). It is clear that this map is holomorphic and it allows us to define a group homomorphism: \[\Pi=\Pi_{p,\ell}:\Gamma\longrightarrow Bihol(\ell)\cong{\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\,,\]  by
 \(\Pi(g)(x)=\pi(g(x))\).
 If we choose another line, say \(\ell^{\prime}\), one gets similarly a projection \(\pi^{\prime}=\pi_{p,\ell^{\prime}}:\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}\setminus\{p\} \to\ell^{\prime}\,,\)to see
 and a group homomorphism
 \(\Pi^{\prime}=\Pi_{p,\ell^{\prime}}:\Gamma\to{\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\)that
 . It is an exercise to see that
 \(\Pi\)and
 \(\Pi^{\prime}\)are equivalent in the sense that there is a biholomorphism \(h:\ell\to\ell^{\prime}\)inducing an automorphism \(H\)of
 \({\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\)such that \(H\circ\Pi=\Pi^{\prime}\). As before, the line \(\ell\)is called _ the horizon_ . 

This leads to the following definition: 

**Definition 1.7.** Let
 \(\Gamma\subset{\rm PSL}(3,\mathbb{C})\)(or
 be a discrete group as above. We call
 \(\Pi=\Pi_{p,\ell}\)the control morphism (or map) and its image
 \(\Pi(\Gamma)\subset{\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\)\(\ell\)up
 , is the
 _ control_ _group_ . These are well-defined and independent of \(\ell\)up to an automorphism of \({\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\).
 

The control map and the control group allow us to get information about the dynamics of
 \(\Gamma\)by looking at a subgroup of
 \({\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\), which is far easier to handle.
 The prize we pay is that the control group in
 \({\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\)may not be discrete.
 

## 2.  Purely parabolic groups 

We now follow [5] and look at the discrete subgroups in
 \({\rm PSL}(3,\mathbb{C})\)that, besides
 the identity, have only parabolic elements. These are called purely parabolic and there are five families of such groups; three of them split into various subfamilies according to their limit set (and their control group, see [8]). All of these are elementary. 

The simplest purely parabolic groups are cyclic, generated by a parabolic element. As described above, there are three types of such elements in PSL(3, C),
 \({\rm PSL}(3,\mathbb{C})\),
 described by the Jordan normal form of their lifts to
 \(\textrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})\)\(\textrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})\)described by the Jordan normal form of their lifts to SL(3, C). Each of these belongs to a different type of the families we describe below. The first type generates
 torus groups (see definitions below), the second generates Abelian Kodaira groups and the ellipto-parabolic elements generate elliptic groups. 

(i) Elliptic groups. These are the only purely parabolic groups that are not conjugate to subgroups of the Heisenberg group
 \({\rm Heis}(3,\mathbb{C})\)and they are
 subgroups of fundamental groups of elliptic surfaces. These have limit set a single line. Up to conjugation these groups are of the form: \[{{\rm Ell}}(W,\mu)=\left\{\left[\begin{array}[]{lll}\mu(w)&\mu(w)w&0\\ 0&\mu(w)&0\\ 0&0&\mu(w)^{-2}\\ \end{array}\right]:w\in W\right\},\]  an
 where \(W\subset\mathbb{C}\) is an additive discrete subgroup and \(\mu:W\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1}\)is a group morphism.
