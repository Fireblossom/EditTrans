**Theorem 14**  (Cf. [ 41 ]) **.**  For a given graph $G$ and one SAUR $\{S_i\}$$\{\bar{S}_i\}$ of $G$, there is a unitary $U$ and standard SAUR $\{\bar{S}_i\}$ such that $US_iU^\dagger = \bar{S}_i \otimes D_i$i

 , where $\{D_i\}$is a set of commuting selfadjoint unitaries. 

The standard SAUR is succinct, however, it loses the information of the symmetry in the graph. To reflect the structure of the graph, we introduce the edge SAUR.

By taking the graph-theoretic approach instead of starting from a special set, we denote $\beta(G,w) = \sos{\saur(G),w}$, where $\saur(G)$ is the set of all SAURs of $G$. The conjecture in ac

such an example is known that β(G) > α(G). To continue, we first introduce the standard SAUR of a given
 graph, which is defined deductively. The standard SAUR can help us to reduce the complexity of considerations, since we only need to focus on the standard SAUR to obtain $\beta(G)$ as we will see later. 

For different SAURs of the same graph $G$, their joint expectation values are related. 

**Definition 12.**  For a given graph $G$ and one of its edges $(i_0,j_0)$, other vertices except $i_0$ and $j_0$ can be devided into four groups $V_0, V_1, V_2, V_3$, such that
