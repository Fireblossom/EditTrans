taking \(\Omega\rightarrow\Omega+\imath 0^{+}\), where we add infinitesimally small imaginary part as it is required in the retarded Green’s function. Then \(a=(\Omega+\imath 0^{+})^{2}+...\) gets small imaginary part \(2\imath\Omega 0^{+}\)defining the value of \(\operatorname{csgn}\). Taking the limit of infinitisimal \(0^{+}\)we arrive at the following expression for the trace of the Green’s function 

\[\text{Tr}\mathbf{G}(\Omega)=\frac{2\Omega}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}dk_{y}\begin{ cases}\frac{\operatorname{sgn}{a}}{\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}}&\text{for}\;\;a^{2}>b^{ 2},\\ \imath\frac{\operatorname{sgn}{\Omega}}{\sqrt{b^{2}-a^{2}}}&\text{for}\;\;a^{2 }\leqslant b^{2},\end{cases}\] (13)  

where we used the fact that the integrand is an even function of \(k_{y}\). Here the values \(a\) and \(b\) are the functions of the variables \(k_{y}\) and \(\Omega\)and the parameter \(m\) as determined by Eqs. (10). 

The DOS is proportional to the imaginary part of \(\text{Tr}G(\Omega)\), therefore it is nonzero only in the region of \(\Omega\)where 

\[a^{2}-b^{2}\leqslant 0.\] (14)  

Outside the region (14) \(\text{Tr}G\) is real and the DOS is equal to zero, i.e., \(\rho(\Omega)=0\). 

The next step in evaluation of Eq. (13) is to perform integration over \(k_{y}\). It is convenient to replace \(y=\cos k_{y}\)and \(dk_{y}=-dy(1-y^{2})^{-1/2}\). The boundaries of the integration are \(-1\leqslant y\leqslant 1\), where changing the order of the integration boundaries results an additional minus sign. The integration over \(y\) is performed differently depending on the value of the parameter \(m\). Therefore, in what follows we are considering three cases with \(|m|=1\), \(|m|>1\), and \(|m|<1\), separately. 

#### Case \(|m|=1\)

Calculations are simpler in the special case of \(|m|=1\). The function in the denominator of the integral (13) can be written explicitly as \(a^{2}-b^{2}=(\Omega^{2}-1)(\Omega^{2}-5-4my)\). It is linear in \(y\) and changes the sign only once at the point \(y=y_{0}\operatorname{sgn}{m}\), where \(y_{0}=(\Omega^{2}-5)/4\). Solving the condition (14) with respect to \(\Omega\)and using the fact that \(|y|\leq 1\) we obtain that DOS is nonzero only for \(1\leq|\Omega|\leq 3\). 

The condition (14) considered with respect to \(y\) determines the boundaries of integration in Eq. (13). For \(m=1\) it is satisfied for \(y_{0}\leq y\leq 1\).Then the imaginary part of Eq. (13) in terms of variable \(y\) gives the DOS in the implicit form 

\[\rho(\Omega)=\frac{|\Omega|}{\pi^{2}\sqrt{\Omega^{2}-1}}\int_{y_{ 0}}^{1}\frac{dy}{\sqrt{(1-y^{2})(y-y_{0})}},\] (15)  where the definition (7) is used. The similar expression will appears for \(m=-1\): the boundaries of integration are \(-1\leq y\leq-y_{0}\)nd denominator in the integrand is 

\(\sqrt{(1-y^{2})(-y-y_{0})}\). The corresponding DOS can be transformed into the result Eq. (15) by replacing the integration variable \(y\rightarrow-y\). So Eq. (15) is valid for both cases \(m=\pm 1\). 

The integral over \(y\) can be calculated in terms of the complete elliptical integral of the first kind \(K(x)\) using the identity (3.131.5) from [20] 

\[\int_{u_{2}}^{u_{3}}\frac{dy}{\sqrt{(u_{3}-y)(y-u_{2})(y-u_{1})}}\] \[=\frac{2}{\sqrt{u_{3}-u_{1}}}K\left[\sqrt{\frac{(u_{3}-u_{2})}{(u _{3}-u_{1})}}\right],\] (16)  



where \(u_{3}>u_{2}>u_{1}\). In Eq. (15) these parameters are \(u_{1}=-1\), \(u_{2}=y_{0}\), \(u_{3}=1\) and the result of integration is equal to 

\(\sqrt{2}K\left[\sqrt{(1-y_{0})/2}\right]\). Then the DOS for \(|m|=1\)is 

\[\rho_{|m|=1}(\Omega)=\begin{cases}\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi^{2}}\frac{|\Omega|}{ \sqrt{\Omega^{2}-1}}K\left[\sqrt{\frac{9-\Omega^{2}}{8}}\right],\;\;\;\;\text{ if}\;\;1\leqslant\Omega^{2}\leqslant 9,\\ 0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\] (17)  

For convenience, in the Appendix A we provide the definitions of the elliptic integrals. 

#### Case \(|m|>1\)

To calculate the DOS for all other values of the parameter \(m\) we need first to analyze the function in denominator of Eq. (13). For \(|m|\neq 1\) we can write \(a^{2}-b^{2}=4(m^{2}-1)(y-y_{1})(y-y_{2})\). Here the left and right zeros of the function are denoted as \(y_{1}=\min(\tilde{y}_{1},\tilde{y}_{2})\) and \(y_{2}=\max(\tilde{y}_{1},\tilde{y}_{2})\), respectively, where 

\[\tilde{y}_{1}=\frac{\Omega^{2}-1-(m+1)^{2}}{2(m+1)},\] \[\tilde{y}_{2}=\frac{\Omega^{2}-1-(m-1)^{2}}{2(m-1)}.\] (18)  \[\tilde{y}_{1}=\frac{\Omega^{2}-1-(m+1)^{2}}{2(m+1)},\] \[\tilde{y}_{2}=\frac{\Omega^{2}-1-(m-1)^{2}}{2(m-1)}.\] (18)  

So we have to set \(y_{1}=\tilde{y}_{1}\), \(y_{2}=\tilde{y}_{2}\) if the the following condition is met 

\[\frac{\Omega^{2}+m^{2}-2}{m^{2}-1}>0,\] (19)  

and to set \(y_{1}=\tilde{y}_{2}\), \(y_{2}=\tilde{y}_{1}\), otherwise. 

Lets consider the case \(|m|>1\), then factor \(m^{2}-1\) is positive. Rewriting Eq. (13) in terms of variable \(y\) and substituting it in Eq. (7), we obtain the nonzero DOS in the implicit form 

\[\rho(\Omega)=\frac{|\Omega|}{\pi^{2}\sqrt{m^{2}-1}}\int\frac{dy}{ \sqrt{(1-y^{2})(y_{1}-y)(y-y_{2})}}.\] (20)  

Here the boundaries of integration are determined by ), which reads \(y_{1}\geq y\geq y_{2}\), implying \(|y|\leqslant 1\). There are two cases, in which these conditions can be satisfied by the integration variable \(y\): 

\[|y_{1}|\leqslant 1,|y_{2}|>1,\] \[|y_{1}|>1,|y_{2}|\leqslant 1.\] (21)
