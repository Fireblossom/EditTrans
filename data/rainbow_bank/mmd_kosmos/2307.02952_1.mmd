The red dashed lines correspond to the chemical po- tential of the localized states obtained when setting \(J=0\). The dashed horizontal black lines correspond to the lowest and highest plane wave condensate states at \(\mu=E=\pm 2J\). The inset highlights the transition point and soliton disap- pearance. ** Right Panels.**  Ground state and highest energy state wavefunction for \(J=1\), \(\gamma=-4.0i\) and length \(L=29\). The blue, green and red curves are the wave function ampli- tude, real part and imaginary part, respectively. 

The corresponding NLSE can be obtained by computing the Poisson bracket \(i\frac{d\Psi_{j}}{dt}=\left\{\Psi_{j},H\right\}=\frac{\delta H}{\delta\Psi_{j} ^{*}}\): 

\[i\frac{d\Psi_{j}}{dt}\] ={−J+γ(2nj−nj−1))}Ψj−1−γΨj2Ψj+1∗ +{−J−γ∗(2nj−nj+1))}Ψj+1+γ∗Ψj2Ψj−1∗, (2)  

which is the one-dimensional Discrete Density Difference Dependent (D ⁴) Non-linear Schr¨odinger equation we are going to explore in this paper. 

We note that the Hamiltonian in Eq.  1  can be also thought of as quantum Hamiltonian by identifying \(\Psi^{*}_{j}\)and \(\Psi_{j}\) as creation and annihilation operators of a particle at site \(j\). Then the Poisson bracket mentioned above should be replaced by a commutator, and D ⁴NLSE describes a situation where the mean-field theory is applicable and the Gross-Pitaevskii treatment of the condensate wavefunction is justified. 

_Ground state phase diagram:—_  We explore the stationary state of the D ⁴NLSE evolving in time as \(\Psi_{j}(t)=e^{-i\mu t}\Psi_{j}(0)\), where \(\mu\) is the chemical potential. Of particular interest is the ground state, which is the state with the lowest energy. We can numerically explore the ground state by the method of imaginary-time propagation, which is to start from a random initial state and simulate the time evolution of the D ⁴NLSE with an imaginary time, that is, to consider the equation obtained after setting \(t=-i\tau\) and simulate the evolution with respect to \(\tau\). After evolving long enough time in \(\tau\), one converges to the ground state (if the ground state is unique) [ 48 ,  49 ]. Assuming periodic boundary condition and applying imaginary time evolution method to various values of \(\gamma\), we see that the ground state is either a plane-wave condensate state or a sharply localized soliton-like state, which we explain now. 

We first note that, for states with a uniform density, \(n_{j}=n_{j+1}\), \(\gamma\)-dependence in the Hamiltonian vanishes. The plane-wave state \(e^{ikx}\)with \(k=2\pi(\mathrm{integer})/L\), where \(L\) is the number of lattice sites, is thus a valid stationary state with chemical potential \(\mu=-2J\cos(k)\). Among the plane wave solutions, the ground state is the \(k=0\)state, and the corresponding chemical potential as well as the energy is \(\mu=E=-2J\). 

Now the question to ask is if one can obtain a state with lower energy by allowing the density to vary. We indeed find that the system can host localized stationary states which we call solitons. Essential features of the soliton can be captured through the following ansatz where the soliton is spread over only three sites around a site \(n\): 

\[\Psi_{n\pm 1} =e^{i\phi_{\pm}}\sqrt{(1-\alpha)/2}, \Psi_{n} =\sqrt{\alpha},\] (3)  

where \(\phi_{-},\phi_{+},\alpha\) are variational parameters which we take as real numbers. We expect that the interaction energy dominates in such soliton states. The transition 

between the \(k=0\)plane wave and the localized ansatz is predicted to be at \(|\gamma|>2.04J\). This agrees well with the transition point from imaginary time evolution, which we find occurs at at approximately \(|\gamma|>1.9J\). We confirm that, for the localized ground state numerically obtained from the imaginary time calculation, typically more than \(\%\)of its weight lies on three sites, supporting the use of our three site ansatz. 

In Fig.  1 , we plot the energy and the chemical potentials for the lowest and highest energy localized soliton states as a function of \(|\gamma|\) obtained from imaginary time evolution. These results were found in excellent agreement also with the ones obtained by means of selfconsistent numerical diagonalizations of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem associated with Eq.  2  [ 30 ]. The symmetry around \(E=0\)is a consequence of an emergent chiral symmetry which we discuss later. At \(|\gamma|>1.9J\), the solitons are the lowest energy states. In the region \(1.67J<|\gamma|<1.9J\), the soliton solution still exists as a stationary state but its energy is higher than the energy of the plane wave condensate state. As \(|\gamma|\) approaches \(\approx 1.67J\) from above, the chemical potential of the soliton changes rapidly, and at \(|\gamma|<1.67J\), the soliton state no longer exists as a stationary state but rather merges with the extended modes. The energy and the chemical potential of the soliton state just above \(|\gamma|\approx 1.67J\) are \(E\approx-1.9J\) and \(\mu\approx-2.3J\). 

_Stability of the condensate:—_  We have just seen that the ground state changes from plane-wave condensate state to localized soliton state as one increases the cou
