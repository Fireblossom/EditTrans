implications for the observed data. It is therefore useful to characterize a falsification test based on these implications to aid researchers to screen out assumptions rejected by the data. The test relies on the fact that the right-hand sides of the inequalities in Proposition 4 must provide a lower bound for a probability mass function if the model assumptions are correct. For any partition \(\mathcal{A}\) of \(\mathcal{J}^{0}\times\mathcal{J}^{0}\), we must have \(\sum_{A\in\mathcal{A}}\mathbb{P}\left[Q_{j}\in A|S_{j}=c_{j}\right]=1\)for any given distribution in the sharp set of Proposition 4. Thus the same sum applied to the right-hand sides of the inequalities above must be less than or equal to one.

Partial identification of the distribution of local preferences allows us to bound the fraction of individuals near cutoff \(c_{j}\) that have \(Q_{j}=(j,k)\). The average outcome near the cutoff is a weighted average of average outcomes from two different groups: first, individuals with \(Q_{j}=(j,k)\), who interest us for the identification of treatment effects; and second, individuals with \(Q_{j}\neq(j,k)\). The overall average is identified but not the average in each of the groups. A strictly positive lower bound on the fraction of individuals in the \(Q_{j}=(j,k)\)group allows us to construct lower and upper bounds on the average outcome for that group. 

Start with all individuals above and near cutoff \(c_{j}\) whose \(\bm{\mathrm{Q}}_{j}\) contain the comparable pair of interest, \((j,k)\in\mathcal{P}\). The fraction of those individuals that have \(Q_{j}=(j,k)\)equals to \[\delta_{j,k}^{+}=\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[Q_{j}=(j,k)|S_{j}=c_{j}\right]}{\mathbb {P}\left[\bm{\mathrm{Q}}_{j}\cap\{(j,k)\}\neq\emptyset|S_{j}=c_{j}^{+}\right]},\]  where both numerator and denominator are strictly positive by virtue of \((j,k)\)being a comparable pair (Definition 5) and sharpness of \(\bm{\mathrm{Q}}_{j}\) (Assumption 6). The denominator of \(\delta_{j,k}^{+}\)is identified from the data, and Proposition 4 bounds the numerator. All we need for identification of treatment effects is a lower bound on \(\delta_{j,k}^{+}\), which comes from a lower bound on its numerator. Let \(\underline{p}_{j,k}\)denote the infimum over all probability values for \(\mathbb{P}\left[Q_{j}=(j,k)|S_{j}=c_{j}\right]\)that belong to the partially identified set of Proposition 4. The sharp lower bound on \(\delta_{j,k}^{+}\)equals to \[\underline{\delta}_{j,k}^{+}=\frac{\underline{p}_{j,k}}{\mathbb{P}\left[\bm{ \mathrm{Q}}_{j}\cap\{(j,k)\}\neq\emptyset|S_{j}=c_{j}^{+}\right]}.\]
