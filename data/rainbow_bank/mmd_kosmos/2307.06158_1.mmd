sites of the lattice involved in the reflection operations and are applied alternatingly in the course of the LSD. It has been shown that the such created one-dimensional lattice shows emergent periodic behavior, i.e. it consists of a transient whose length depends on the concrete values of \(n,m\) followed by a subsequent periodic behavior. By construction, the local symmetries of this lattice are strongly overlapping. A spectral analysis of the tightbinding (TB) realization of the \(n:m\) LSD chains demonstrated the control possibilities of the localization properties of the eigenstates by the nested local symmetries. 

In the present work we go one step further and establish a type of rule which does not possess emergent periodicity but leads to a scaling behavior of the chain. As a consequence we have similar repeating units along the lattice but, in each step, they are stretched with respect to their lengths i.e. the number of sites is correspondingly increased. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of a TB implementation of the scaled chain. The eigenvalue spectrum shows a distinct transition from two to three branches and finally to a single branch with increasing off-diagonal coupling strength. The fluctuations of the energy level spacings cover several orders of magnitude and exhibit minigaps. A density of state analysis shows a strongly peaked behavior at the crossover points of the branches. We develop a local resonator model which allows us to interpret and understand this spectral behavior. Our eigenstate analysis demonstrates the unique localization properties of this scaled chain and in particular their variation with changing coupling strength. Finally we investigate the energy-dependent transmission profile by attaching leads to the scaled chain. It shows a transition from few to many isolated complete transmission peaks and finally, for smaller values of the coupling, we observe a decreasing spectral transmission window with an irregular fluctuating behavior. 

This work is structured as follows. In section II we introduce our LSD rule and the resulting scaled chain and map it onto a TB Hamiltonian. Section III presents an analysis of the energy eigenvalue spectrum of scaled chains including the energy spacing distributions and density of states. In section IV we develop the local resonator model which offers a deeper understanding of the spectral properties and we compare it to the TB results. Section V provides an analysis of the eigenstates including their localization behavior. The transmission properties of our scaled chain are explored in section VI with varying coupling strength. Finally, in section VII we present our conclusions. 

## THE SCALED LSD CHAIN: SETUP AND HAMILTONIAN 

The local symmetry dynamics (LSD) represents a concept which allows us to generate lattices with local symmetries starting from a given initial condition, i.e. from an initial finite segment of a lattice. One important way to achieve this is to perform reflection operations of a certain domain size at the end of a given finite lattice. In ref.[20] the special case of the \(n:m\) rules, where \(n,m\)stand for the number of sites to be reflected alternatingly, has been investigated: it provides us with emergent periodicity in the sense that a spatially evolving transient is followed by a periodic behavior of the lattice. By construction, the resulting lattice exhibits a plethora of local overlapping symmetries. 

Employing a symbolic code we focus here on the rule \(n,(n+1),(n+2),(n+3),...\) which represents an LSD with monotonically increasing sizes of the reflection domains. The initial seed has to be \(n\) elements and we use here \(n=2\)i.e. the seed \(AB\). As an example, we provide the tenth generation of the application of this rule which reads as follows 

\[AB|_{2}BA|_{3}ABB|_{4}BBAA|_{5}AABBB|_{6}BBBAAA\] |7AAABBBB|8BBBBAAAA|9AAAABBBBB |10BBBBBAAAAA|11AAAAABBBBBB |12BBBBBBAAAAAA|13AAAAAABBBBBBB  

where |k stands for the reflection operation exerted on \(k\) sites to the left of its position. Obviously, our rule leads to a scaling behavior in the sense that we have alternating sequences of \(A\) and \(B\) sites whose lengths increase with increasing generation of the chain. Alternatively, this can be noted as \(1A,2B,2A,4B,4A,6B,6A,....2nB,2nA\)which amounts to a total length of \(N=1+2n(n+1)\). We therefore call this chain a scaled chain (SC). 

In order to explore the spectral and transmission properties of the SC we map it onto a corresponding TB Hamiltonian [21]. We hereby assume a constant offdiagonal coupling \(t\) between nearest neighbors \(\langle i,j\rangle\)of a discrete chain of length \(N\) with sites \(\{i|i=1,...,N\}\). The corresponding on-site energies \(\epsilon_{i}\) follow the LSD of the SC. Specifically we will use in the following the values \(\epsilon_{A}=1.0,\epsilon_{B}=2.0\)for the sites of type \(A,B\), respectively. Our TB Hamiltonian reads therefore as follows 

\[{\cal{H}}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\epsilon_{i}|i\rangle\langle i|+\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}t|i\rangle\langle j|\] (1)  

Note that we are using open boundary conditions for the SC allover this work.
