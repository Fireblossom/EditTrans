Single-photon loss thresholds for the minimal and cyclic architectures constructed using GHZ-state measure- ments and resource states that are encoded in a quantum parity code (QPC). The hardware implementation of the en- coded measurements comprises either only static, or active linear-optical components. Each solid line shows thresholds for a choice of architecture, i.e., minimal or cyclic, and mea- surement implementation, i.e., using static or active linear optics, at various QPC code sizes and thus, number of pho- tons per resource state. For comparison, we also show the threshold (gray triangle) of the construction from Ref. [ 6 ] us- ing a 24-photon QPC-encoded resource state. 

tons in their resource states. We observe that when constructed with resource states of a similar size and the same type of encoded BSM, the cyclic architecture always outperforms the minimal architecture. We compare our cyclic architecture with the 24-photon, encoded six-ring FBQC construction, of which the single-photon loss threshold is \(2.7\%\)[ 28 ], and find two significant im\(75\%\)higher threshold \(\sim 4.75\%\)using resource states of the same size, and (2) a similar threshold \(\sim 2.5\%\)using resource states with \(\frac{1}{3}\)fewer photons, i.e., 16 photons. We further observe that for any combination of architecture, i.e., minimal or cyclic, and encoded BSM, i.e., static or active, the loss threshold can be improved by enlarging the encoding and thus, resource states. We include thresholds up 

to \(\sim 12\%\)in Fig.  4 , though higher thresholds are attainable, because the required number of photons per resource states far exceeds current experimental capabilities; the resource states that enable a \(\sim 12\%\)threshold are roughly ten times larger than the largest, to our knowledge, experimentally generated photonic resource state [ 24 ]. 

## DISCUSSION 

In this work, we investigate MBQC architectures that achieve fault-tolerance by fusing two-qubit resource states via GHZ-state measurements. Tailoring the architectures to linear optics, we encode the GHZ-state measurements and resource states in a quantum parity code to suppress errors due to photon loss and the probabilistic nature of linear optics. Our simulations show that enlarging the quantum parity code and thus the resource states can increase photon-loss thresholds, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of our encoded GHZ-state measurements. Furthermore, we obtain high thresholds using resource states with modest numbers of photons, comparable to the largest experimentally generated photonic resource states. 

A non-limiting list of exploration beyond our work shown herein includes encoding GHZ-state measurements in different codes [ 45 ,  46 ], exploiting biased errors [ 35 ], employing different resource states [ 20 ], and considering fusion networks that are not derived from foliation [ 47 ,  48 ]. Beyond quantum computation, our encoded GHZ-state measurements may also find use in quantum communication (see App.  B 2  for further discussion). For instance, they may be used to perform multipath routing, which can enhance entanglement rates in quantum networks [ 49 ,  50 ].
