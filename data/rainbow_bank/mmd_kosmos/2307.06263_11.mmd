To simplify the analysis, a narrow frequency band was selected between 24 and 61 Hz, with the fourth and fifth bending modes of the blades dominating the response in this band. Although other modes appear to have a small influence in this band, a 2DOF assumption was imposed. (This assumption results in smoothing of the FRF over the band, and might result in some loss of interpretability, but is acceptable for these preliminary analyses). The real part was modelled as a probabilistic FRF, using the FRF estimate from Eq. (13) as the mean of the likelihood function, as described in Case 1, presented in Section 6 of this paper. The real parts of the averaged FRFs for each blade, at the second accelerometer from the blade root (corresponding to the drive-point location), are shown in Figures 5a and 5b. Figure 5a shows the full measured bandwidth, and Figure 5b shows the FRF in the bandwidth of interest, between 24 and 61 Hz. 

Figures 5a and 5b show increasing variability with respect to frequency, which is an expected result, given that higher-frequency modes are more sensitive to small physical changes than lower-frequency modes. For modes less than 80 Hz, the maximum frequency difference among the blades was approximately 2.5 Hz; for modes greater than 80 Hz, the maximum frequency difference was approximately 6.3 Hz. Note the grouping visible at several of the peaks, where Blades 1 and 2 appear closely aligned in frequency while Blades 3 and 4 appear closely aligned. These results are quite relevant for PBSHM. All of the helicopter blades are healthy, and represent a normal-condition state of the population. Consider a situation where only FRFs from one of the groupings are available for training a model (or FRFs from the other groups are missing data). The normal condition could be heavily biased towards the training set, and incoming FRFs could be flagged as damaged, even if they are healthy. Further details regarding the data collection and processing for these tests can be found in [27].
