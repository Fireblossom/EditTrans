**Note 4.1.** The asymptotically negligible term \(1/n\) on the right-hand side of the first equation of \(G_{n}\) ensures that \(G_{n}\) makes sense for all sample sizes. Without this term we may get counterintuitive values. For example, when the ‘incomes’ are \(X_{1}=1\), \(X_{2}=2\)and \(X_{3}=3\), we have \(G_{n}=2/9\), whereas \(G_{n}\)without the added \(1/n=1/3\)would give the negative value \(-1/9\), which is incompatible with the meaning of the index. 

Finally, using the same arguments as above but now with the right-most expression for \(G_{2}\) given in Section  2.2  as our starting point, we arrive at \[G_{2,n}={\bar{X}\over X_{\lceil n/2\rceil:n}}-{2\over n^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{ \sum_{k=1}^{i}X_{k:n}\over X_{\lceil n/2\rceil:n}}\]  as an empirical estimator of \(G_{2}\). As before,  \(\bar{X}\)\(\bar{X}\) stands for the mean of \(X_{1},\dots,X_{n}\). 

### An analysis of capital incomes from the ECHP 2001 survey 

Using the formulas for calculating the aforementioned indices from data, we now analyze capital incomes reported in the European Community Household Panel survey ( ECHP ,  2001 ) that was conducted by Eurostat in 2001, which is the last of the eight waves of the survey. 

Specifically, the data come from 59,750 households with 121,122 persons from the fifteen European countries specified in Table  4.1 

 using the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (two-letter) codes. By looking at the means and medians in Table  4.1 , we see how skewed to the right the distributions of the countries are. Figure  4.1  (with \(G_{2,n}\) excluded due to its large values) 

visualizes the index values calculated using formulas ( 4.1 )–( 4.3 ) and reported in Table  4.1 . For a more detailed description of the data and relevant references, we refer to  Greselin et al.  ( 2014 , Section 1). Next are several observations based on Table  4.1  and Figure  4.1 . 

Portugal has the lowest value of \(\Psi_{1,n}\), with the median income of the poorest \(p\times 100\%\)persons equal, after averaging over all \(p\in(0,1)\), to \(84.7\%\)of the median income of the entire population. 

The opposite happens in France, which provides the highest contrast among the countries when comparing the median income of the poorest \(p\times 100\%\)persons with the overall median income: after averaging such ratios over all \(p\in(0,1)\), we obtain \(21.7\%\). 

For France, we also observe the largest value of \(\Psi_{3,n}\). The median income of the poorest \(p\times 100\%\)people is equal, after averaging over all \(p\in(0,1)\), to only \(15.5\%\)of the median
