Ref. [ 3 ]. To be more precise, we find that 

\[|a_{n}-1|\propto n^{1.4}\Delta t^{2}\,,\] (50) \[|\tilde{b}_{n}+b_{n}/\Delta t|\propto(n\Delta t)^{2}\,,\] (51)  

for \(n\Delta t\lesssim 1\). Note that in this regime the unitary superoperator is close to being tridiagonal. The diagonal elements being close to one reflects the appearance of the identity in Eq. ( 48 ), whereas the off-diagonal elements \(b_{n}\)reproduce the off-diagonal elements \(\tilde{b}_{n}\)\(\tilde{b}_{n}\)from the Liouvillian dynamics up to a rescaling by \(\Delta t\). In this regime, the operator dynamics of the Trotterized circuit can hence be expected to remain close to the operator dynamics of the original Hamiltonian. 

However, this regime cannot persist for arbitrarily large values of \(n\). In chaotic systems the off-diagonal elements \(\tilde{b}_{n}\)\(\tilde{b}_{n}\)in the Liouvillian are expected to grow with the maximal possible rate as \(n\)increases, corresponding to growth in the offdiagonal element of \(\mathcal{U}\) since \(b_{n}\approx-\tilde{b}_{n}\Delta t\). However, unitarity restricts the matrix elements of \(\mathcal{U}\) to satisfy \(|\mathcal{U}_{mn}|\leqslant 1\), such that the growth of \(b_{n}\)is necessarily bounded. 

_Maximally ergodic dynamics_ . The second regime appears at larger values of \(n\). Here \(a_{n}=\mathcal{\mathcal{U}}_{n+1,n}\approx 1\) and all other matrix elements \(\mathcal{U}_{m,n}\approx 0\) for \(m\neq n+1\), with the errors decreasing exponentially with increasing \(n\). This structure of the Krylov matrix is identical to the structure previously observed in dual-unitary circuits in Eq. ( 31 ), indicating that in each step the Heisenberg evolution with \(U\)creates a new operator that is linearly independent from all previously generated operators in the Krylov subspace. In this regime the operator dynamics in the unitary circuit is qualitatively different from that of the Hamiltonian system. As one example, we can again consider the autocorrelation function for a Krylov operator |ùí™n). In the circuit case, the autocorrelation identically vanishes after a single discrete time step (up to exponentially small corrections), same as in dual-unitary circuits, which is prohibited in the Hamiltonian case. Here we can also contrast the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation function, since in the Hamiltonian case the autocorrelation function is expected to reach a nonzero thermal value constrained by conservation of energy, again to be contrasted with the vanishing autocorrelation function in the unitary circuit. 

_Crossover regime._  The remaining question is about the origin of the transition scale and the collapse observed when recscaling \(n\)with \(\Delta t^{g}\). As it turns out, this scale is very closely related to the size of the operator and operator spreading. We expect a transition in the behaviour of the circuit once an operator |ùí™n) acts non-trivially on around \(\ell\sim 1/\Delta t\)sites. While the full support of both |On) and |ùí™n) grows linearly in \(n\), the bulk of the operator typically acts on a smaller number of sites, as quantified in, e.g., out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) and operator spreading [ 16 ‚Äì 18 ]. While the support of |On) is by now well understood through studies in, e.g., random unitary circuits, these results do not directly translate to the support of |ùí™n). We quantify the operator growth in the usual way, considering 

\[\mathrm{OTOC}(n,j)=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\mathcal{O}_{n}^{\dagger} \sigma^{\gamma}_{j}\mathcal{O}_{n}\sigma^{\gamma}_{j}\right]/\mathcal{D}\,,\] (52)  

with \(\gamma\in\{x,y,z\}\). We observe that this profile resembles an error function, as also expected for |On), and define \(\ell\)as the value of \(n\)where the error function equals \(1/2\). The results are shown in Fig.  4 . For the considered range of \(\Delta t\), we have that \(\ell\propto n^{0.65}\). In combination with \({\ell}\sim 1/\Delta t\)this roughly yields the observed transition on a scale \(n\sim\Delta t^{-1.5}\). However, we note that this exponent is not universal since it crucially depends on \(\Delta t\), which is apparent when considering different limits. 

For large \(\Delta t\)we expect the operator spreading for |ùí™n) and |On) to coincide and exhibit the biased diffusive growth previously observed [ 16 ‚Äì 18 ], corresponding to an operator growth \({\ell}\propto n\). For very small \(\Delta t\), we can approximate the unitary superoperator by the Liouvillian. In this limit the operator growth is subballistic, as most of the local operators in the Hamiltonian act on the bulk of the operator |ùí™n). We hence expect the operator growth to increase from subballistic growth in the limit \(\Delta t\to 0\) to ballistic growth for large \(\Delta t\), with an intermediate superdiffusive but nonuniversal regime corresponding to the scaling observed in Fig.  3 . 

_Spectral function._  The results from the previous section can be understood on the level of the spectral function, which also allows us to make exact statements about the existence of the maximally ergodic regime as a stable attractor for the orthonormalization procedure. On the level of the spectral function, maximally chaotic dynamics corresponds to the spectral function of the Krylov operators being a flat function. These spectral functions are plotted in the left panel of Fig.  5  for different values of \(n\), and we indeed observe that the spectral function flattens with increasing \(n\). 

Following Eq. ( 27 ), these spectral functions are related to the spectral function of the initial operator as 

\[|f_{\mathcal{O}_{n}}(\omega)|^{2}=|f_{O}(\omega)|^{2}|p_{n}( \omega)|^{2}\,,\] (53)  

where \(p_{n}(\omega)\) are the polynomials representing the Krylov operators, which are orthonormal polynomials with \(|f_{O}(\omega)|^{2}\)as weight functions. Stating that the Krylov operators flow to 

FIG. 4. Spatial extent \(\ell\)of the Krylov operators |ùí™n) with increasing \(n\). The extent is measured by fitting the error function to the OTOC calculated for each |ùí™n) for different \(\Delta t\). Here \(\ell\)is estimated by the point where the error function takes half its maximum value. For small \(\Delta t\), the extent of the operator grows roughly as \(\ell\propto n^{0.65}\). The same \(\mathcal{U}\) and simulation setting was used as in Fig.  3 . For details see \(\mathcal{U}\)Appendix  G .
