##### Abstract
Quantum tomography is a widely applicable method for reconstructing unknown quantum states and processes. However, its applications in quantum technologies usually also require estimating the difference between prepared and target quantum states with relivable confidence intervals. In this work, we suggest a computationally efficient and reliable scheme for determining well-justified error bars for quantum tomography. We approximate the probability distribution of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the target state and the estimation, which is given by the linear inversion, by calculating its moments. We also present a generalization of this approach for quantum process tomography. We benchmark our approach for a number of quantum tomography protocols using both simulated and experimental data. The obtained results pave a way to the use of the suggested scheme for complete characterization of quantum systems of various nature. 

## INTRODUCTION 

Quantum technologies strongly require the ability to prepare quantum states with desired properties [ 1 ]. In this regard, one of crucial tasks is to estimate the difference between the states that are actually prepared and the desired one, which requires solving the problem of complete characterization of quantum states and processes. The art of solving this problem is known as quantum tomography that uses the measurement statistics in multiple bases (for a review, see Ref. [ 2 ]). Being a gold standard in quantum physics experiments, quantum tomography is routinely performed for systems of various nature, ranging from quantum-optical states [ 3 ] to trapped-ion quantum simulators [ 4 ]. However, along with the various benefits, this method encounters a number of challenges. The first issue related to the efficiency of quantum tomography, which becomes unwieldy for large and complex quantum systems, which are required for quantum technologies [ 5 ]. A number of methods for improving the performance of quantum tomography protocols have been suggested [ 4 ,  6 – 10 ], and the latest results are related to the use of neural-network quantum state representation for tomographic reconstruction [ 9 – 13 ]. 

Another important issue is supplying quantum tomography protocols with efficient methods for the estimation of their reconstruction accuracy [ 14 – 23 ]. Most of the existing practical techniques for estimating the accuracy of quantum tomography protocols are based on heuristic approaches, while only a few methods are established rigorously [ 21 ,  23 – 25 ]. Existing approaches for solving this problem encounter an obstacle of combining computational efficiency, which takes place for heuristic methods, and provable accuracy, which is a feature of rigorous methods (however, their estimations are typically quite pessimistic so that yielding error bars, which are unnecessarily large). Consequently, finding a tradeoff between the computational efficiency of the method and provable accuracy is highly important for ongoing experiments. This problem becomes even more significant for quantum process tomography (QPT) [ 24 – 28 ], which is an important tool for characterizing the quality of operations performed by quantum devices [ 29 ,  30 ]. 

In this work, we present a computationally-efficient approach for solving this problem, which demonstrates the best performance among existing rigorous approaches. The idea is that the probability distribution of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the experimentally prepared state and the estimation, which is given by the linear inversion, can be approximated by calculating its moments. We benchmark our approach for a number of quantum tomography protocols for states and processes using both simulated and experimental data, where the latter are generated using a publicly accessible superconducting quantum processor. As we expect, our results provide a computationally efficient and still rigorously justified approach for quantum tomography of states and processes. 

Our work is organized as follows. In Sec.  II , we provide a short description of the general quantum state tomography protocol (QST) for a finite-dimensional system. In Sec.  III , we discuss rigorous confidence regions for QST. In Sec.  IV , we present a generalization of the method of obtaining confidence regions for QPT. In Sec.  V , we describe a method of computing confidence intervals in terms of more practical metrics, such as fidelity or mean value of observable. In Sec.  VI , we present a performance analysis of our approach, where we use several quantum states, in particular, 3-qubit GHZ state, for the QST, and also single-qubit depolarizing channel and noisy quantum teleportation channel for the QPT setting. We conclude in Sec.  VII . 

## QUANTUM STATE TOMOGRAPHY 

Let us first briefly consider a standard QST protocol. We are interested in a quantum system assigned with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\hil$ with a corresponding space $\mathcal{L}(\hil)$$\hil$of Hermitian operators over $\hil$. The quan
