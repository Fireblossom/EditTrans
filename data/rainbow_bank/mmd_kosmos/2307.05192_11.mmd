ous in \(\chi\) and thus so is \(F_{av}(\Lambda^{\epsilon,\chi}(\psi),\phi)\).  Therefore, for each given \(\epsilon\), it holds that \(\forall\epsilon^{\prime\prime}>0\)\(\exists\chi>0\)such that \(|F_{av}(\Lambda^{\epsilon,\chi}(\psi))-F_{av}(\Lambda^{\epsilon}(\psi),\phi)| \leq\epsilon^{\prime\prime}\). 

Thus, for any \(\eta>0\), choose \(\epsilon,\epsilon^{\prime\prime}>0\)such that \(\epsilon+\epsilon^{\prime\prime}\leq\eta\), and then 

|Fe⁢n⁢s(ψ,ϕ) −Fa⁢v(Λϵ,χ(ψ))| \[\leq|F_{ens}(\psi,\phi)-F_{av}(\Lambda^{\epsilon}(\psi),\phi)|\] \[\qquad+|F_{av}(\Lambda^{\epsilon}(\psi),\phi)-F_{av}(\Lambda^{ \epsilon,\chi}(\psi))|\] \[\leq\epsilon^{\prime\prime}+\epsilon\leq\eta,\] (31)  

which proves the result for \(\delta=0\). 

To extend to the \(\delta>0\)case, it is sufficient to consider the maximum achievable fidelity from any state within the \(\delta\)-vicinity. Let \(|\tilde{\psi}\rangle\)with \(F(\tilde{\psi},\psi)\geq 1-\delta\) be the input state for this optimal transformation. Then the above argument applied to this transformation proves the claim. 

As a final comment, we recall that \(\text{LOCC}_{\text{N}}\) ensemble transformations within an SLOCC class are a subset of SEP ₁ ensemble transformations [50] (see Appendix VII A for further details). 

## APPROXIMATE TRANSFORMATIONS 

Having introduced approximate transformations and identified five physically relevant types ( \(T_{ens}^{\delta,\epsilon}(\psi,\phi)\)etc.), we now set out to better understand these transformations. A complete characterisation of these sets of transformations seems unfeasible. To see this, consider for instance the set \(T_{det}^{\delta,\epsilon}(\psi,\phi)\). In order to characterise this set, one must characterise all deterministic transformations from any state in the \(\delta\)-vicinity around \(\left|\psi\right>\)to a state in the \(\epsilon\)-vicinity around \(\left|\phi\right>\). However, for any finite \(\delta>0\), there may be an infinite number of SLOCC classes intersecting the \(\delta\)-vicinity around \(\left|\psi\right>\). Moreover, in the general cases, one must also consider transformations to non-fully-entangled states, which is challenging by itself. 

Nonetheless, in the coming sections, we will lay out the landscape of approximate transformations. We have seen that, in the bipartite setting, the hierarchy between these transformations collapses as the optimal fidelity is always achievable with a deterministic transformation. In the following, we will show that the multipartite landscape is considerably richer. In Section IV A, we begin by considering the maximally entangled set (MES) under approximate transformations. Then in Section IV B, we consider transformations in which we start exactly with the initial state. That is, we set \(\delta=0\). Here we start in Section IV B 1 with the simplest approximate transformations, i.e., \(T_{ens-SLOCC}^{0,\epsilon}\)and \(T_{det-SLOCC}^{0,\epsilon}\). We show that, unlike the bipartite case, there are ensemble transformations within an SLOCC class that are better than any deterministic transformation within an SLOCC class (see Fig 2). 

From here, we move on to study general faithful transformations in Section IV B 2. Here we study how \(T_{ens}^{0,\epsilon},\)and \(T_{det}^{0,\epsilon}\)relate to one another. We show that, unlike the bipartite case, there are cases in the multipartite setting where the optimal approximate transformation is nondeterministic (see Fig. 3). We also present a multipartite example where the optimal faithful transformation is deterministic and extend these results to the setting where \(\delta>0\), but sufficiently small. In Appendix VII C, we also discuss the limiting case where \(\epsilon\to 0\). 

Finally, in Section IV C, we tackle the question of whether there are really significantly more approximate transformations than deterministic transformations; namely, are there approximate transformations which are not in the vicinity of any exact, deterministic transformation? More precisely, in Section IV C, we set \(\delta=\epsilon>0\)– in effect, fixing a resolution, up to which we can identify states – and provide strong numerical evidence for the existence of an approximate transformation with no deterministic transformation between the corresponding \(\epsilon\)-vicinities around the initial and final states (see Fig. 4). 

### MES 

FIG. 2: Approximate transformations within an SLOCC class are more powerful than deterministic transformations within an SLOCC class. 

FIG. 3: In the multipartite case, the optimal transformation is not always deterministic. There are choices of states \(\left|\psi\right>\)and \(\left|\phi\right>\)and \(\epsilon>0\)such that a faithful ensemble transfor- mation of \(\left|\psi\right>\)is possible (blue dashed lines), but there is no deterministic transformation of \(\left|\psi\right>\)into the \(\epsilon\)-vicinity around \(\left|\phi\right>\).
