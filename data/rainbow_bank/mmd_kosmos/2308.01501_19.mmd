tests showed that our method can compute polynomials of degree greater than \(10^{7}\)in under a minute, an impressive computational efficiency when compared to the \(10^{4}\)degree polynomials that can be achieved using existing QSP approaches via the state-of-the-art techniques of [14]. 

In this paper, we explored several applications of our GQSP methodology. We presented an optimized algorithm for quantum fractional queries, along with a simplified technique for performing Hamiltonian simulation using qubitization. We proposed methods for calculating phase functions, such as the square root, and unveiled new methodologies for synthesizing circulant matrices and performing convolution operations. 

As we look forward, our work reveals several potential areas for further exploration. A primary question is how to adapt the principles of our approach to multivariable QSP [15]. Also, our focus on QSP suggests the potential of applying similar concepts to quantum singular value transformation for transforming block-encoded non-square matrices. In essence, this paper represents a significant progression in the QSP/QSVT framework. The exploration and understanding of the broad range of opportunities offered by these techniques promise to be a primary focus of research in quantum algorithms in the years to come.
