\(d_{\lambda}=2\)as shown in Ref.  [ 23 ]. These two examples demonstrate superunsteerability both the ways as they are symmetrical with respect to interchanging Alice and Bob. In the following, we demonstrate an example of superunsteerability asymmetrically. 

_One-way Superunsteerability:-_  Consider that the two spatially separated parties (say, Alice and Bob) share the following separable two-qubit state, 

\[\rho=\frac{1}{2}\Big{(}|00\rangle\langle 00|+|+1\rangle\langle+1|\Big{)},\] (8)  

where, \(|0\rangle\)and \(|+\rangle\)are the eigenstates of the operators \(\sigma_{z}\)and \(\sigma_{x}\), respectively, correspondng to the eigenvalue \(+1\). The above state has quantum discord \(D^{\rightarrow}(\rho_{AB})>0\)and \(D^{\leftarrow}(\rho_{AB})=0\)(see Appendix B for the definition of quantum discord) since it is not a classical-quantum state but a quantum-classical state [ 11 ,  12 ]. If Alice performs the projective measurements of observables corresponding to the operators \(A_{0}=\sigma_{x}\)and \(A_{1}=\sigma_{z}\), and Bob performs projective measurements of observables corresponding to the operators \(B_{0}=\sigma_{x}\) and \(B_{1}=\sigma_{z}\), then the following correlation is produced from the above quantum-classical state, 

\[P(ab|xy)=\begin{tabular}[]{c|cccc}\diagbox[dir={NW}]{{\shortstack[l]{(x,y)}}}{ {\shortstack[r]{(a,b)}}}{}&(0,0)&(0,1)&(1,0)&(1,1)\\ \hline\cr\\[1.42271pt] (0,0)&$\dfrac{1}{2}$&$\dfrac{1}{4}$&$0$&$\dfrac{1}{4}$\\[14.22636pt] (0,1)&$\dfrac{3}{8}$&$\dfrac{3}{8}$&$\dfrac{1}{8}$&$\dfrac{1}{8}$\\[14.22636pt ] (1,0)&$\dfrac{1}{4}$&$\dfrac{1}{2}$&$\dfrac{1}{4}$&$0$\\[14.22636pt] (1,1)&$\dfrac{3}{8}$&$\dfrac{3}{8}$&$\dfrac{1}{8}$&$\dfrac{1}{8}$\\ \end{tabular}\] (9)  

Here \(x\), \(y\) denote the input variables on Alice’s and Bob’s sides respectively; and \(a\), \(b\) denote the outputs on Alice’s and Bob’s sides respectively. In the following, we demonstrate that the box ( 9 ) detects super-unsteerability of the quantum-classical state ( 8 ). 

Let us now proceed to analyse simulating the correlation given by Eq.( 9 ) with LHV at one side and LHS at another side. The correlation given by Eq.( 9 ) can be written as 

\[P(ab|xy)\] =18(PD0000+PD0001+PD0010+PD0011 +PD1000+PD1101+PD1010+PD1111), (10)  

giving rise to the following LHV-LHS model: 

\[P(ab|xy)=\sum_{\lambda=0}^{2}p(\lambda)P(a|x,\lambda)P(b|y,\rho_{\lambda}),\] (11)  

where \(p(0)\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(p(1)\) = \(p(2)\) = \(\frac{1}{4}\); \(P(a|x,0)\) = \(P_{D}^{00}\), \(P(a|x,1)\) = \(P_{D}^{10}\), \(P(a|x,2)\) = \(P_{D}^{11}\); 

and 

\[P(b|y,\rho_{0})\!=\!\frac{P_{D}^{00}+P_{D}^{01}+P_{D}^{10}+P_{D} ^{11}}{4}\! =\!\begin{tabular}[]{c|cc}\diagbox[dir={NW}]{{\shortstack[l]{(y)} }}{{\shortstack[r]{(b)}}}{}&(0)&(1)\\ \hline\cr(0)&$\frac{1}{2}$&$\frac{1}{2}$\\ (1)&$\frac{1}{2}$&$\frac{1}{2}$\\ \end{tabular}\] (15) \[=\!\langle\psi^{{}^{\prime}}_{0}|\{\Pi_{b|y}\}_{b,y}|\psi^{{}^{ \prime}}_{0}\rangle,\]  

\[P(b|y,\rho_{1})\!=\!\frac{P_{D}^{00}+P_{D}^{10}}{2}\! =\!\begin{tabular}[]{c|cc}\diagbox[dir={NW}]{{\shortstack[l]{(y)} }}{{\shortstack[r]{(b)}}}{}&(0)&(1)\\ \hline\cr(0)&$1$&$0$\\ (1)&$\frac{1}{2}$&$\frac{1}{2}$\\ \end{tabular}\] (19) \[=\!\langle\psi^{{}^{\prime}}_{1}|\{\Pi_{b|y}\}_{b,y}|\psi^{{}^{ \prime}}_{1}\rangle,\]  

\[P(b|y,\rho_{2})\!=\!\frac{P_{D}^{01}+P_{D}^{11}}{2}\! =\!\begin{tabular}[]{c|cc}\diagbox[dir={NW}]{{\shortstack[l]{(y)} }}{{\shortstack[r]{(b)}}}{}&(0)&(1)\\ \hline\cr(0)&$0$&$1$\\ (1)&$\frac{1}{2}$&$\frac{1}{2}$\\ \end{tabular}\] (23) \[=\!\langle\psi^{{}^{\prime}}_{2}|\{\Pi_{b|y}\}_{b,y}|\psi^{{}^{ \prime}}_{2}\rangle,\]  

where \(\{\Pi_{b|y}\}_{b,y}\) corresponds to two arbitrary projective mutually unbiased measurements in the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{C}^{2}\)corresponding to the operators B0=|↑0⟩⟨↑0|\(-\)|↓0⟩⟨↓0|and B1=|↑1⟩⟨↑1|\(-\)|↓1⟩⟨↓1|; here {|↑0⟩, |↓0⟩} is an arbitrary orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{C}^{2}\)and the orthonormal basis \(\{|\uparrow_{1}\rangle,|\downarrow_{1}\rangle\}\) in the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{C}^{2}\)is such that aforementioned two measurements define two arbitrary projective mutually unbiased measurements in the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{C}^{2}\). The \(|\psi^{{}^{\prime}}_{\lambda}\rangle\)s that produce \(p(b|y,\rho_{\lambda})\)s given above are given by \(|\psi^{{}^{\prime}}_{0}\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|\uparrow_{0}\rangle+i\frac{1 }{\sqrt{2}}|\downarrow_{0}\rangle,\)\(|\psi^{{}^{\prime}}_{1}\rangle=|\uparrow_{0}\rangle,\) and \(|\psi^{{}^{\prime}}_{2}\rangle=|\downarrow_{0}\rangle,\) which are all valid states in the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{C}^{2}\). 

Hence, the LHV-LHS decomposition of the correlation given by Eq.( 9 ) can be realized with hidden variable having \(3\)(with two arbitrary projective mutually unbiased measurements at trusted party). This is also the minimal hidden variable dimension needed to simulate the correlation as we show in the following lemma. 

**Lemma 1.** _ The LHV-LHS decomposition of the correlation_ _given by Eq.(_ _9_ _) cannot be realized with hidden variable hav-_ _ing dimension_ \(2\)_._ 

The proof of this lemma is given in Appendix C. We now show the following result. 

**Theorem 1.** _ The correlation given by Eq.(_ _9_ _) demonstrates_ _super-unsteerablity from Alice to Bob while having no super-_ _unsteerablity from Bob to Alice._ 

_Proof._  We have shown that the unsteerable correlation given by Eq.( 9 ) can have a LHV-LHS model with the minimum di\(3\). On the other hand,
