The above example illustrates the agent’s power the choice of the information structure provides. By choosing the aforementioned information structure, not only the agent is able to implement \(e_{3}\), i.e., the efficient level of effort, but also she is able to capture the entire surplus. In what follows, we show that under some conditions on the performance technology, this is always possible. 

## Efficient Surplus Extraction 

In this section, we provide sufficient conditions on the performance technology f(⋅|⋅) and cost function \(c\left(\cdot\right)\) so that the agent is able to implement the first-best effort and extract the entire surplus. 

Let \(e^{*}\)be the first-best level of effort that satisfies 

\[e^{*}\in\arg\max_{e\in E}\quad \mathbb{E}\left[g(x)|e\right]-c\left(e\right).\]  

Suppose that the agent wishes to implement \(e^{*}\)and capture the entire surplus
