## Introduction 

_Distributionally robust optimization_  (DRO) has emerged as a powerful tool for hedging against model misspecification and distributional shifts. It minimizes _distributional model risk_  (DMR) defined as the worst risk over a class of distributions lying in a _ distributional uncertainty set_ , see Blanchet and Murthy ( 2019 ). Among many different choices of uncertainty sets, Wasserstein DRO (W-DRO) with distributional uncertainty sets based on optimal transport costs has gained much popularity, see Kuhn et al. ( 2019 ) and Blanchet et al. ( 2021 ) for recent reviews. W-DRO has found successful applications in robust decision making in all disciplines including economics, finance, machine learning, and operations research. Its success is largely credited to the strong duality and other nice properties of the Wasserstein DMR (W-DMR). The objective of this paper is to propose and study W-DMR in _ marginal problems where only some marginal measures of a reference_ _measure are given_ , see e.g., Kellerer ( 1984 ), Rachev and R¨uschendorf ( 1998 ), Villani ( 2009 ), and Villani ( 2021 ), and R¨uschendorf ( 1991 ). 

In practice, _ marginal problems_  arise from either the lack of complete data or an incomplete model. In insurance and risk management, computing model-free measures of aggregate risks such as Value-at-Risk and Expected Short-Fall is of utmost importance and routinely done. When the exact dependence structure between individual risks is lacking, researchers and policy makers rely on the worst risk measures defined as the maximum value of aggregate risk measures over all joint measures of the individual risks with some fixed marginal measures, see Embrechts and Puccetti ( 2010 ) and Embrechts et al. ( 2013 ); In causal inference, distributional treatment effects such as the variance and the proportion of participants who benefit from the treatment depend on the joint distribution of the potential outcomes. Even with ideal randomized experiments such as double-blind clinical trials, the joint distribution of potential outcomes is not identified and as a result, only the lower and upper bounds on distributional treatment effects are identified from the sample information, see Fan and Wu ( 2009 ), Fan and Park ( 2010 ) and Fan and Park ( 2012 ), Fan et al. ( 2017 ), Ridder and Moffitt ( 2007 ), Firpo and Ridder ( 2019 ); In algorithmic fairness when the sensitive group variable is not observed in the main data set, assessment of unfairness measures must be done using multiple data sets, see Kallus et al. ( 2022 ). Abstracting away from estimation, all these problems involve optimizing the expected value of a functional of multiple random variables with fixed marginals and thus belong to the class of marginal problems for which optimal transport related tools are important. 1 1 When the marginals are univariate, optimal transport problem can be conveniently expressed in terms of copulas. Fan and Park ( 2010 ), Fan and Park ( 2012 ), Fan and Wu ( 2009 ), Fan et al. ( 2017 ), Ridder and Moffitt ( 2007 ), and Firpo and Ridder ( 2019 ) explicitly use copula tools.
