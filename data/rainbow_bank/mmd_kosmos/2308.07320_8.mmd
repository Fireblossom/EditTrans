This figure below depicts the Linear Interpolation Imputation dataset Plot. 

The ADF test for Linear Interpolation imputation dataset test-statistic = -5.390 p-value = 3.53e-06 for first difference to try to change the time-series to stationary test-statistic = -10.072 p-value = 1.24e-17 for Second Difference, which is not suggested as the p-value is zero (over-differencing) test-statistic = -21.44 p-value = 0.0
