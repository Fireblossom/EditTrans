the final assignment. The prescribed collusive ranking model in this article demonstrates that if the platform acts as an agent and redefines a new assignment, the final assignment will be changed to a collusive or joint profit-maximizing assignment based on the criteria. It demonstrates that if any of the following criteria are proposed, namely _ products related to this item_ , _ more to consider from made_ _for Amazon_ , _compare with similar items_ , _customers who viewed this item also viewed_ , etc... then the allocation will be collusive. By minimizing the customer’s mismatch problem, the next level ranking or shortlisting vendors is to be done out of the first level shortlisting vendors. This mismatch can be reduced by updating online reviews with a Bayesian approach. Because online reviews are nothing more than sequential voting, they contain a history of customer preferences. As a result, relying solely on the current review comments is insufficient to assess the object’s quality. This information must also be updated to determine the quality of future services. 

### Model Setup: Problem Formulation 

Imitation of third-party products and self-preferencing are important tools used to direct customers to the platform’s products[Hagiu et al., 2022]. As a result, it should maintain equal access from both sides, namely the customer and the firms. On E-Commerce platforms, there are currently two types of seller ranking. The first is sponsored, while the second is not. Sellers who chose the sponsored ranking mechanism must participate in the auction bidding process to win the slot. The remainder is managed by manipulating keywords, review ratings, review comments, and so on. Furthermore, platforms have some hidden mechanisms in place to push their products. The current article proposes a general model for retrieving the query so that every seller can benefit concerning their strength, particularly those who do not participate in the sponsored ranking mechanism. The proposed model is the development of an algorithm that solves the preceding two problems so that the search algorithm is not collusive. Otherwise, the search algorithm will be collusive, and the platform will have the power to control the market in favor of certain interest groups. 

#### Analysis: Assortment Planning and the Revenue Maximization Problem 

We consider a marketplace (platform) where a set of \(K\) substitutable goods or services offered by the \(K\) individual vendors, henceforth, called the _ products_ -are offered to a market of customers who decide whether to buy one of them or to choose a no-purchase option. Let \([k]\triangleq\{1,...,k\}\) denote the universal set of products. The online platform (he) chooses an assortment \(S\subset[k]\) to display and rank them in order within \(M\) slots. This has to be done in tow stage process; \(S_{1}\&S_{2}(=S)\). First \(S_{1}\subset[k]\) thereafter \(S_{2}(=S)\subseteq S_{1}\). The platform sells this single product over a horizon of length \(T\) and each vendor is holding more than one product. It will be convenient to think of this planning horizon in terms of
