## SELFADJOINT UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS 

tation relations of such a set $\{S_i\}$ can be encoded into a so-called frustration graph $G$ [ 11 ,  12 ], where $i\sim j$ if $\{S_i, S_j\} = 0$, and $i\not\sim j$ if $[S_i, S_j]=0$. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oldConjecture}     \sos{\{S_i\}} = \alpha(G). \end{equation}

tion in Ref. [ 25 ]. Conversely, for a given graph $G$, we can consider its representation by a set $\{S_i\}$ of selfadjoint unitaries, in the sense that $\{S_i,S_j\} = 0$ if $i\sim j$and $[S_i,S_j] = 0$ if $i\not\sim j$. This representation is called a special set, we denote $\beta(G,w) = \sos{\saur(G),w}$, where $\saur(G)$ is the set of all SAURs of $G$. The conjecture in   ac
Eq. is equivalent to $\beta(G) = \alpha(G)$. In Ref. , no such an example is known that $\beta(G) > \alpha(G)$. To conobtain $\beta(G)$ as we will see later. 

**Definition 12.**  For a given graph $G$ and one of its edges $(i_0,j_0)$, other vertices except $i_0$ and $j_0$ can be devided into four groups $V_0, V_1, V_2, V_3$, such that 

$i\not\sim i_0$ and $i\not\sim j_0$ for any $i\in V_0$; $i\not\sim i_0$ and $i\sim j_0$ for any $i\in V_1$; $i\sim i_0$ and $i\sim j_0$ for any $i\in V_2$; $i\sim i_0$ and $i\not\sim j_0$ for any $i\in V_3$. 

The subgraph $G'$of $G$ with vertices in $\cup_{i=0}^4 V_i$ is said to be a Pauli$(i_0,j_0)$-induced subgraph of $G$ if 


* $i\in V_{k_1}, j\in V_{k_2}$ where $k_1\neq k_2 \in \{1,2,3\}$, we have $i\sim j$ (or $i\not\sim j$) in $G'$if and only if $i\not\sim j$ (or $i\sim j$) in $G$; 
* $i\sim j$ in $G'$if and only if $i\sim j$ in $G$. 

**Definition 13.**  For a given graph $G$ and one of its edges $(i_0,j_0)$, denote $G'$the Pauli$(i_0,j_0)$-induced subgraph of $G$, from a standard SAUR $\{S'_i\}$ of $G'$, we call the following SAUR a standard one of $G$: 

\begin{equation}       \mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\originalleft(\bigcup_{k=0}^3 \{\sigma_k\otimes S'_i\}_{i\in V_k}\aftergroup\egroup\originalright) \cup \{X_{i_0}\otimes {\operatorname{id}}, Z_{j_0}\otimes {\operatorname{id}}\}.     \end{equation}

If $G$ has no edge, we assign ${\operatorname{id}}$ or $1$ to all its vertices. 

If we take the pentagon $C_5$ in Fig.  2  as the original graph, and $(1,3)$ as the edge, then the Pauli$(1,3)$induced subgraph $G'$is a triangle. Pauli$(4,5)$-induced subgraph $G''$of $G'$is just the vertex $2$. Hence, the standard SAURs $\{S''_i\}, \{S'_i\}$ and $\{S_i\}$of $G'', G'$and $G$, respectively, are 

\begin{align}     &S''_2 = 1, S'_2 = Y, S'_4 = X, S'_5 = Z,\\     &S_1 = X{\operatorname{id}}, S_2 = {\operatorname{id}} Y, S_3 = Z{\operatorname{id}}, S_4 = X X, S_5 = Z Z,  \end{align}

and $X{\operatorname{id}}$ means $X\otimes {\operatorname{id}}$ etc. 

**Theorem 14**  (Cf. [ 41 ]) **.**  For a given graph $G$ and one SAUR $\{S_i\}$ of $G$, there is a unitary $U$ and standard SAUR $\{\bar{S}_i\}$ such that $US_iU^\dagger = \bar{S}_i \otimes D_i$, where $\{D_i\}$

**Definition 15.**  For a given graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and the edge set $E$, the set of selfadjoint operators $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^n$with $A_i = \otimes_{e\in E} O_{e,i}$ is called the edge SAUR of $G$, where $O_{e,i} = X$ if $i$ is the start of $e$, and $O_{e,i} = Z$ if $i$ is the end of $e$, otherwise, $O_{e,i} = {\operatorname{id}}$. 

For different SAURs of the same graph $G$, their joint 

Theorem  For a given graph $G$, $\sos{\{S_i\}} = \sos{\{\bar{S}_i\}}$where $\{S_i\}$ is a SAUR of $G$ and $\{\bar{S}_i\}$ is a standard one. 

_Proof._  From the convexity of $\sum_i \mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\originalleft\langle S_i \aftergroup\egroup\originalright\rangle^2$, we know that we only need to prove for the case that $\rho$ is a pure state $|\psi\rangle\langle \psi|$. Since $D_i$ commutes with each other, we can assume $D_i$’s are diagonal matrices. Denote $d_2$ the dimension of $D_i$’s, then we have the decomposition 

\begin{equation}    U|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{d_2} \sqrt{p_i} |\phi_i\rangle \otimes |i\rangle,  \end{equation}

where $p_i \ge 0$ and $\sum_i p_i = 1$. 

\begin{align}    \mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\originalleft\langle S_i \aftergroup\egroup\originalright\rangle &%= \mean{\bar{S}_i \otimes D_i}     = \sum_{kl} \sqrt{p_ip_j} \langle \phi_k|\bar{S}_i|\phi_l\rangle \langle k|D_i|l\rangle\nonumber\\    &= \sum_k p_k \langle \phi_k|s_{ik} \bar{S}_i|\phi_k\rangle,  \end{align}
