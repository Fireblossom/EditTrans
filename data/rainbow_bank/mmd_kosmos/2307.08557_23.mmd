private so that agent \(i\) knows only his own bonus \(v_{i}\) but not those of his opponents. In Halac et al. (2021), the private nature of bonus offers creates what these authors call _ rank_ _uncertainty_ . Specifically, let \(t_{i}\) denote the rank of agent \(i\), all \(i\in\mathscr{N}\) , and let \(T\) denote the set of all permutations on the player set \(\mathscr{N}\) . A ranking \(t=(t_{i})\in T\) assigns a rank to each agent \(i\in\mathscr{N}\) . 

In a _ ranking scheme_ , no two players are assigned the same rank and the bonus to agent \(i\)makes him indifferent between working and shirking is he believes that all agents \(j\) ranked lower than \(i\) work while those ranked higher do not work. The expected payoff to work for agent \(i\) with rank \(t_{i}\) offered a bonus \(v_{i}\) in a ranking scheme is \[v_{i}\cdot\left[q\left(\{j\in\mathscr{N}:t_{j}\leq t_{i}\}\right)-q\left(\{j \in\mathscr{N}:t_{j}<t_{i}\}\right)\right]-c_{i},\]  where \(q\left(\{J\}\right)\) denotes the probability of project success when all agents \(j\in J\subseteq\mathscr{N}\) work while agents \(j\notin J\) do not work. Now let \(\mu_{i}\) be agent \(i\)â€™s ranking belief, i.e. his distribution on the rankings \(t\in T\). Given his belief \(\mu_{i}\), the bonus \(v_{i}\) that is necessary to make player \(i\)indifferent between working and not working is given by \[v_{i}=\frac{c_{i}}{\sum_{t\in T}\mu_{i}(t)\left[q\left(\{j\in\mathscr{N}:t_{j} \leq t_{i}\}\right)-q\left(\{j\in\mathscr{N}:t_{j}<t_{i}\}\right)\right]}.\]  The principal in Halac et al. (2021) tries to find those bonuses and ranking distribution that induce work as the unique equilibrium of the game at minimal cost. They show that, for symmetric agents, an optimal policy is a ranking scheme that induces uniform beliefs over all possible rankings. This convergence to uniform beliefs bears interesting resemblance to the policy derived in Proposition 1, which establishes that in a global game (with or without symmetric agents) an optimal bonus makes agent \(i\) who observes signal \(x_{i}^{\varepsilon}=\tilde{x}\)exactly indifferent between working and shirking under a uniform belief about the number of agents that work.
