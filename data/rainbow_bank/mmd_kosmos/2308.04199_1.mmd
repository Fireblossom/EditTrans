## INTRODUCTION 

Unlike earlier discoveries in theoretical physics prior to 1925, Quantum Mechanics was the result of the efforts of more than one man, namely: Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, Dirac and Schr¨odinger. It was indeed Heisenberg who made the first and major step in the discovery of Quantum Mechanics, his priority and legacy is therefore unquestionable 4 . However, had he not made that step, it is clear from the historical developments that it would have been Schr¨odinger who would claim priority, though his perspective using the de Broglie matter wave mechanical approach, though ubiquitous, had turned out to be incorrect eventually. Some physicists famously Weinberg 6 and also Fermi 7 , considered Heisenberg’s paper of July 1925 incomprehensible because it was clouded in mystery as to why he made the assumptions that he did and what motivated the steps in his thinking. In 2004 Aitchison et al 8 made an attempt to provide an “understanding” of Heisenberg’s July 1925 paper by filling in the apparent gaps in the calculational details (some omitted by Heisenberg in his 1925 paper) thereby making a reconstruction of this landmark paper. While their effort is instructive and may be useful for the teaching of advanced courses in quantum mechanics, and may have relieved Weinberg’s and Fermi’s “incomprehensibility” objection, it has done little in my opinion to elucidate the “magical” part of Weinberg’s observations. Although one concur with Aitchison et al 8 that it may not in fact be possible to “render completely comprehensible the mysterious processes” whereby physicists “gain new insights about nature” through a phenomenal breakthrough, nevertheless there are some useful clues that are worth exploring. This is so, especially as it is now a century after the development of the subject, many of whose stones had been laid as early as the period from 1925 to 1927 and are in need of scrutiny under a modern lens. By doing so we will not only make the process of discovery less “magical” and plausible, but in this case we may also gain some new insight, one missed during the last century, that might lead us closer to a solution for Albert Einstein’s famous Quantum Riddle, by which he meant: what are “the principal reasons behind the quanta?” 1,9 . The words Quantum Riddle were coined by Einstein himself ( _not_  Lande 1 ) as early as 1923 10 but the spirit of the riddle has been in his writings and correspondence even earlier since 1916 1 until his death in 1954 with numerous interpretations as to its meaning 10 . For this paper we shall stick closely to Lande’s 1 version, in fact explicitly defining here the quantum riddle as the origin for the Born-Jordan-Heisenberg quantization rule eqn(1) from
