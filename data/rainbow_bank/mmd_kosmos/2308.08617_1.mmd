In the context of high-order schemes, mathematical frameworks have been developed in order to construct schemes of arbitrary spatial discretization order [4, 5]. Among the well-documented ones are the Discontinuous Galerkin [6, 7], the Spectral Differences [8] and the Spectral Volumes [9] class of schemes. More recently, another approach for constructing high-order schemes has been introduced in the literature: the Flux Reconstruction [10], also referred to as FR. This framework is capable of creating compact high-order schemes for solving partial differential equations. Special focus was given to the treatment of advection terms [10] and diffusion terms [11], which are integral components of high-fidelity mathematical models used in fluid dynamics, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. 

In the Flux Reconstruction approach, the solution is known at multiple discrete points, also known as nodes, within a discrete domain element: a cell. A continuous solution is reconstructed within the cell by performing an interpolation using a basis of Lagrange polynomials. In general, the overall resulting solution will be continuous only within a cell, usually displaying discontinuities across the interfaces between two adjacent cells. Therefore, if nothing else is done, there is no interaction between nearby cells. The main idea behind the FR framework is to introduce means for information to propagate through the domain. This is done by defining common values for the property fluxes (and its derivatives, if needed) across a cell interface. For the advection terms, the interface fluxes are usually reconstructed in an upwind manner, with the Roe flux [12] being a popular procedure to be used. For the diffusion terms, the common fluxes are taken to be, in its most general case, a weighted average between the fluxes of the immediate adjacent cells. A corrected, continuous, flux function can, then, be reconstructed within a cell, in such a way that the previously defined common interface values are respected. Finally, the time-derivatives of the solution properties can be evaluated by using the corrected fluxes and, then, integrated by using an appropriate time-march scheme selected by the user. 

An interesting characteristic of the FR framework is that the continuous reconstruction of the flux terms is performed by using a special set of functions, called “correction functions”, and, depending on the function(s) used, different high-order schemes are achieved. For instance, schemes such as the nodal Discontinuous Galerkin [6] and the Staggered Grid [13] can be recovered by using the Flux Reconstruction in combination with an appropriate correction function. One important step that must be made towards the comprehension of the properties of a scheme is the assessment of its stability bounds and effective order of accuracy. In the case of the FR framework, part of this process has already been done by Huynh [10] and documented for a limited number of scheme orders. The present paper aims to expand this analysis by using the FR framework with 5 different correction functions and using cells with up to 10 internal nodes. The resulting schemes are, then, used to solve the 1-D advection model equation. Observations are done regarding the effects of the artificial dissipation over the transient solution, obtained by using a forth-order Runge-Kutta time-marching procedure (RK4). Further insights regarding the stability and accuracy of the resulting schemes are obtained by performing a Fourier analysis on each one of them. 

## NUMERICAL FORMULATION 

In this section, a brief explanation is given regarding the Flux Reconstruction approach for the construction of high-order schemes. The intention is to give the reader sufficient background knowledge regarding the inner workings of the FR approach before performing the Fourier stability analysis in the next section. 

The equation of interest is the initial value problem (IVP) given by the 1-D advection model equation: 

\[\begin{cases}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=0,\; \;\;\text{ with }\;\;\;f=au\\ u(x,t)|_{t=0}=u_{0}(x)\end{cases}\] (1)  

where \(t\) is the time coordinate, \(x\) is the space coordinate, \(u(x,t)\)is the property being transported by a wave, whose dynamics is given by Eq. (1), with constant speed \(a\). Finally, \(f\) is the flux term and the main subject of interest to the FR approach. The discrete domain can be constructed by dividing its continuous counterpart into multiple cells \(E\), where the \(j\)-th cell is denoted by \(E_{j}\) and has a length \(h_{j}\). Each cell is composed of \(K\) nodes, which is where the discrete solution, \(u(x,t)\), is evaluated at. The centroid of cell \(E_{j}\) is located at \(x_{j}\), and the coordinate of the \(k\)-th node of the \(j\)-th cell is denoted by \(x_{j,k}\). Following the same naming convention, the solution evaluated at \(x_{j,k}\) is defined as \(u_{j,k}\), which is a function of time only. The coordinate of the interface located between elements \(E_{j}\) and \(E_{j+1}\) is
