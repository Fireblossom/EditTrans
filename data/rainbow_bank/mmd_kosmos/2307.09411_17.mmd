density function evaluated at a single point. Rather, \(\partial\Pr(\mathcal{I}^{*}=\mathcal{I}_{1}|\mathbf{x})/\partial\mathbf{x}^{ \texttt{I}}\)maps into a linear combination of the density function evaluated at cutoffs \(\mathcal{V}^{1}_{k}(\mathbf{x}^{\texttt{I}}),k>1\). In contrast, here by properly utilizing variation in \(\mathbf{x}^{\texttt{II}}\)

## Model & Data on Choices in Automobile Insurance we are able to create such a mapping even though there can be multiple preference types. 

### Empirical model 

As introduced in Section  2.1 , we model agents’ choices in two contexts of insurance coverage, where each coverage provides full insurance against covered losses in excess of a deductible chosen by the agent. In our data, the decision maker is a household; hence, we refer to agents as households. As a reminder, \(\mu_{i}^{j}\)denotes the probability of household \(i\) experiencing a claim in context \(j\); for each coverage \(j\in\{\texttt{I},\texttt{II}\}\), household \(i\) faces a menu of premium-deductible pairs, \(\mathcal{M}_{i}^{j}\equiv\{(\texttt{d}^{\ell j},\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\ell j}):\ell \in\mathcal{D}^{j}\}\), where \(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\ell j}\)is the household-specific premium associated with deductible \(\texttt{d}^{\ell j}\)and \(\mathcal{D}^{j}\)is the set of deductible options offered in context \(j\). As discussed in Section  2.1 , for each context \(j\in\{\texttt{I},\texttt{II}\}\) the ratio of the price of deductible \(\texttt{d}^{\ell j}\)to the price of deductible \(\texttt{d}^{kj}\)is constant across households for all \(\texttt{d}^{\ell j},\texttt{d}^{kj}\in\mathcal{D}^{j}\). 

We make assumptions, that are widespread in the literature on property insurance, related to filing claims and their probabilities: 

Assumption  4.1 : _ [Restrictions Related to Claim Probabilities]_ _ line_ 

_(I) Households disregard the possibility of experiencing more than one claim during the_ _policy period._ _(II) Any claim exceeds the highest available deductible; payment of the deductible is the only_ _cost associated with a claim; the household’s deductible choice does not influence its_ _claim probability._ 

We assume that the two types of preferences described in Section  2.2  result from either Expected Utility Theory (EU) or Yaari’s ( 1987 ) Dual Theory (DT). Within EU, a singlecontext lottery is evaluated through 

\[U_{i}(\mathcal{L}(\texttt{d}^{\ell j},\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\ell j}, \mu_{i}^{j}))\equiv(1-\mu_{i}^{j})u_{i}(w_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\ell j})+\mu_{i} ^{j}u_{i}(w_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\ell j}-\texttt{d}^{\ell j}),\  

where \(w_{i}\) is the household’s wealth and \(u_{i}(\cdot)\) is its Bernoulli utility function, which under Assumption  2.2  is the same for each context. In the EU model, utility is linear in the probabilities and aversion to risk is driven by the shape of the utility function \(u_{i}(\cdot)\).
