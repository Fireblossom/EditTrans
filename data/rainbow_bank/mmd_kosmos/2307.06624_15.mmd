The time evolution of a single trajectory mutual information, between regions \(A\) and \(B\), with \(l_{A}=l_{B}=L/4\), is shown in Fig.( 13 ). The picture is qualitatively the same as in Fig.( 12 ). A difference we observe is that the values of mutual information for both \(t_{2}=5\)and \(t_{2}=1.5\)are reduced and stronger fluctuations are present. Also, for larger systems, the time it takes for the system to saturate to a steady state seems to exceed 100 time-steps. 

Considering these results, we conclude that for \(p=1\), a safe estimate for the amount of time it takes to achieve convergence is \(t_{st}=100\)for small systems ( \(L\leqslant 64\)) and \(t_{st}=1000\)for larger systems ( \(L>64\)).

In Fig.( 14 ) we present the dynamics of the fermionic negativity for a single trajectory, for \(l_{A}=L/2\)bipartition. The results correspond to a single fixed system size of \(L=128\)and \(p=0.25,0.5,0.75\)measurement probabilities. As explained in Sec.( 3.2 ), the peculiar growth of fermionic negativity with respect to \(p\) for \(t_{2}=5\)is already evident on a single trajectory level, Fig.( 14 b). 

Based on these results, it is safe to fix \(t_{st}=100\)as the time when the system reaches the steady state.
