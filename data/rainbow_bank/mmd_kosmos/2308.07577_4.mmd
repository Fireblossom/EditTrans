regularly put forward but whose analysis has been neglected thus far. To properly capture the nonlinear dynamics of the competitive storage model, we follow the approach of Koop et al.  ( 1996 ) who define the IRFs as state-and-history-dependent random variables. The simulated IRFs show that prices immediately decline after a positive interest rate shock and converge slowly to their long-run value. Moreover, an interest rate increase depresses storage and increases price volatility. Inventories decrease immediately with the shock but reach their lowest value after a long time, and convergence to the long-run average is even slower compared with price. Price volatility mostly follows stock dynamics: a larger response in inventory causes an oppositely larger response in price volatility. Finally, the magnitude and overall pattern of the IRFs depend substantially on the market supply and interest rate regimes. 8 

Our work joins a large literature on the relationship between interest rates and commodity prices. Jeffrey Frankel made numerous empirical and theoretical contributions on the topic, with an emphasis on how commodity prices overshoot their long-run target following a shock because of their inherent price flexibility ( Frankel and Hardouvelis ,  1985 ; Frankel ,  1986 ,  2008 ,  2014 8 ). This literature has tended to find a negative effect of interThese results suggest that postulating an invariant effect of monetary shocks under different market est rate hikes on commodity prices in the short ( Rosa supply and interest rate regimes may cause biases in empirical analysis. ,  2014 ;  Basistha and Kurov ,  2015 ; Scrimgeour ,  2015 ) and medium run ( Akram ,  2009 ;  Anzuini et al. ,  2013 ;  Harvey et al. , 2017 ), with the exception of  Kilian and Zhou  ( 2022 ) who find no effect of real interest rate movements on oil prices. The negative relationship of interest rates and commodity prices has also been detected by  Christiano et al.  ( 1999 ) and  Bernanke et al.  ( 2005 ) in other contexts. In addition, interest rates not only affect commodity price levels, but also their cross-correlation and their volatility as shown by  Gruber and Vigfusson  ( 2018 ). Compared with these studies, the method developed here allows for a systematic analysis of the transmission mechanisms. In particular, our quantitative analysis clarifies the role of the speculative channel in the observed negative relationship. 

Our work contributes also to the studies of the theoretical and empirical properties of the competitive storage model. Theoretically, we derive new results on the existence and uniqueness of a rational expectations equilibrium in a general competitive storage model with state-dependent and time-varying discount factors, which extend the results of  Scheinkman and Schechtman  ( 1983 ),  Deaton and Laroque  ( 1992 ),  Cafiero et al.  ( 2015 ) and is crucial for studying the dynamic causal effect of these factors on commodity price fluctuations. 9 9 See also  Basak and Pavlova  ( 2016 ) for another storage model with stochastic discount factor but which abstracts from the non-negative constraint on storage. In addition, we provide a sharp characterization of the analytical properties of the equilibrium solution, based on which we develop a suitable endogenous grid
