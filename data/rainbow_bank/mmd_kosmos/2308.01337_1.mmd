We study a \(7.7\)-km-long hollow-core nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (NANF) [ 17 ]. Our specific NANF was previously investigated in Ref. [ 16 ]. It is composed of two individual HCFs, measuring \(3.38\) km (NANF 1) and \(4.34\) km (NANF 2), that are spliced together (see Fig. 1 c). The average propagation loss of the NANF at a wavelength of \(1550\) nm is estimated to be \(0.82\) dB/km, which exceeds that of standard telecom SMF28 fiber. Nevertheless, recent advancements have shown that a so-called double nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (DNANF) lowers the propagation loss to \(0.174\) dB/km [ 25 ], which is approximately equal to that of SMF28 fiber. Moreover, HCFs can even surpass the fundamental loss limit imposed by Rayleigh scattering in solid-core fibers [ 18 ]. 

Our experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In brief, we generate polarization-entangled photon pairs. We then convert one polarization qubit into a timebin qubit, then transmit that time-bin qubit through a long distance fiber (either HCF or SMF28), and, finally, we convert the time-bin qubit back into a polarization qubit. We implement this “conversion protocol” for three reasons: (1) We can make use of well established polarization-entangled photon-pair sources. (2) Timebin encoding is one of the leading candidates for longdistance QKD. (3) By converting back to a polarization qubit, we can easily implement arbitrary measurements on the final two-qubit state, allowing for a complete characterization of the entanglement distribution. 

To generate entangled photon pairs at \(1550\) nm, we use a Type-II SPDC source in Sagnac configuration (Fig.  1 green area) [ 26 ]. The measured spectral full width at half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of the source is \(\Delta\lambda\approx\leavevmode\nobreak\ 0.859\) nm, and assuming transform limited Gaussian pulses, we calculate the coherence time of the photons to be \(\tau_{\text{c}}\approx 4.1\) ps (which yields \(\tau_{\text{c}}\approx\leavevmode\nobreak\ 2.4\) ps when expressed as a standard deviation). Initially, we prepare a 2-qubit polarization-entangled Bell state \(\ket{\Psi^{-}}=\leavevmode\nobreak\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{HV}_{12}-\ket{VH}_{ 12}\). Photon 1 is directly coupled to a quantum state tomography (QST) stage consisting of a quarter- (QWP), a half-waveplate (HWP), and a polarizing beam splitter (PBS). Photons at each output port of the PBS are detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) from Single Quantum (Fig.  1  yellow area). Our detectors have an average detector jitter of \(\approx 21\) ps, an average detection efficiency of \(87\%\), and a dark count rate \(<100\) Hz. 

Meanwhile, “Photon 2” is coupled to a “qubit conversion interferometer”(Fig.  1  red area), which converts the polarization qubit to a time-bin qubit. To accomplish this, the photon is first sent to a PBS so that if the photon is horizontally (vertically) polarized, it is transmitted (reflected) to the short (long) path. A HWP at \(45^{\circ}\)in the long path flips the polarization state from \(\ket{V}\)to \(\ket{H}\). Then the two paths are recombined using a fiber 50/50 beamsplitter (BS). We discard the cases wherein Photon 2 exits in the lower arm of the BS using the optical circulator shown in the blue section of Fig.  1 . While this could be avoided using active optical switches [ 28 ,  29 ], for our picosecond time-bin spacings this would require GHz switching speeds. This results in Photon 2 encoding a time-bin qubit in the upper output mode of the BS. Pho
