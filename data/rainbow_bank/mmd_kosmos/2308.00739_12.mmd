On the brane \(Q\), it becomes 

\[\left.\frac{y^{2}}{R^{2}}\right|_{Q}=\frac{\sin^{2}\eta}{\quantity(\cos t+\cos \eta)^{2}}.\] (21)  

When \(t=0\), it simplifies to 

\[\left.\frac{y^{2}}{R^{2}}\right|_{Q}=\frac{1-\cos^{2}\eta}{\quantity(1+\cos \eta)^{2}}=\frac{1-\cos\eta}{1+\cos\eta}=\tan^{2}\frac{\eta}{2}.\] (22)  

We conclude by presenting a useful geometric property concerning \(\eta\). Consider a geodesic that is symmetric around \(\theta=0\), and its intersection with \(Q\), as depicted in Fig.  5 . When the geodesic extends from \(x=-L\) to \(L\) in the Poincare coordinates, the value of \(y\)at the intersection of the brane and the geodesic is given by \(y=L\). From ( 3.13 ), the corresponding value of \(\eta=\eta(L)\) satisfies 

\[\frac{L^{2}}{R^{2}}=\frac{\sin^{2}\eta(L)}{\quantity(\cos t+\cos\eta(L))^{2}}.\] (23)  

On the other hand, the \(\theta\) coordinate \(\theta(L)=\pm\phi\) at the asymptotic boundary corresponding to \(x=\pm L\) satisfies 

\[\frac{\sin^{2}\theta(L)}{(\cos t+\cos\theta(L))^{2}}=\frac{(r\sin\theta(L))^{2 }}{(r\cos t+r\cos\theta(L))^{2}}=\left.\frac{x^{2}}{R^{2}}\right|_{r \rightarrow\infty}=\frac{L^{2}}{R^{2}},\] (24)  

where we used \(r\sim\sqrt{R^{2}+r^{2}}\)

at the asymptotic boundary \(r\rightarrow\infty\)in the second 

\[\eta(L)=-\phi=\theta(x=-L),\] (25)  

### Holographic quantum task between brane and boundary 

\(Q\), where the scattering happens at the center of pure AdS (Fig.  6  (a)). This requires \(T>0\). We fix the input point \(c_{2}\) and output point \(r_{2}\) on the asymptotic boundary \(\Sigma\). The output point \(r_{1}\) is placed on the edge of the brane \(\eta=0\). The location of the input point \(c_{1}\) on \(Q\) is given by the intersection of 

\[\begin{cases}\theta&=-\pi/2\\ r\sin\theta&=-\lambda R,\\ -(r^{2}+R^{2})dt^{2}+\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}+R^{2}}dr^{2}&=0.\end{cases}\] (26)
