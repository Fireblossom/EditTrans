**Lemma 3.** _ Let_ \(\Gamma=(S,A,\Omega,p,u)\)_ be an information aggregation game with_ \(\Omega=\{\omega^{1},\ldots,\omega^{m}\}\)\(E\)a system of equations over \(x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}\)such that equation \(x_{i}\leq x_{j}\)\(E\)if and only if \(\vec{\omega}^{i}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}_{j}\)\(\vec{\omega}^{i}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}_{j}\)_ or if_ _there exists an input_ \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\)such that \(\vec{\omega}^{i}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{j}\)\(\vec{\omega}^{i}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{j}\). Then, \(y_{1},\ldots,y_{m}\)\(E\)if and only if \[\omega^{i}\leq_{k}\omega^{j}\Longrightarrow y_{i}\leq y_{j}\]  for all \(i,j\in[m]\)_._ 

Intuitively, Lemma 3 says that the inequalities obtained from chains of length 2 or 3 _ span_  the partial order over \(\Omega\)defined by \(\leq_{k}\), and thus that we can take the system of equations \(E\) of Theorem 1 to be the one in the lemma above. Therefore, given two states \(\omega\) and \(\omega^{\prime}\), it only remains to show that we can check in polynomial time if \(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)\(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)or if there exists a state \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) such that \(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)\(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\). Checking if \(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)\(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)is equivalent to checking if \(k=n\)\(1\)in \(\omega\)\(0\)in \(\omega^{\prime}\). Finding an input \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) such that \(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)\(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)reduces to finding an input \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) such that 

(a) the set \(C_{\omega}\) of senders such that their message is not \(\omega\) in \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) has size at most \(k\), and all senders in \(C_{\omega}\)\(1\)to \(0\)in \(\omega\). (b) the set \(C_{\omega^{\prime}}\) of senders such that their message is not \(\omega^{\prime}\)in \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) has size at most \(k\), and all of them \(0\)to \(1\)in \(\omega^{\prime}\). 

The high level idea of the algorithm is that, if \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) satisfies the above properties, all senders \(i\) that prefer \(0\)to \(1\)in \(\omega\) must satisfy that \(m_{i}=\omega\) (otherwise, it breaks property (a)), and all senders \(i\)\(1\)to \(0\)in \(\omega^{\prime}\)must satisfy that \(m_{i}=\omega^{\prime}\)(otherwise, it breaks property (b)). If there is a sender \(i\)\(0\)to \(1\)in \(\omega\)\(1\)to \(0\)in \(\omega^{\prime}\)then such an input \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) does not exist, and if there is a sender \(i\) that strictly prefers \(1\)to \(0\)in \(\omega\)\(0\)to \(1\)in \(\omega^{\prime}\), then \(m_{i}\) has no constraints. The only remaining restriction is that there can only be at most \(k\) values different than \(\omega\) and at most \(k\) values different than \(\omega^{\prime}\)(note that this implies that if \(2k<n\) such an input does not exist). The algorithm goes as follows: 


1. Split the set of senders into four subsets\(X_{0,1}^{0,1},X_{0,1}^{1,0},X_{1,0}^{0,1},X_{1,0}^{1,0}\), in which \(X_{i,j}^{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\)is the set of senders that prefer \(i\) to \(j\) in \(\omega\) (resp., strictly prefer if \(i=1\)) and prefer \(i^{\prime}\)to \(j^{\prime}\)in \(\omega^{\prime}\)(resp., strictly prefer if \(i^{\prime}=0\)). 
2. If\(X_{0,1}^{1,0}\not=\emptyset\)or \(2k<n\), there is no solution. 
3. If\(|X_{0,1}^{0,1}|>k\) or \(|X_{1,0}^{1,0}|>k\), there is no solution. 
4. Otherwise, set\(m_{i}=\omega\) for all \(i\in X_{0,1}^{0,1}\), \(m_{i}=\omega^{\prime}\) for all \(i\in X_{1,0}^{1,0}\). Then, set \(k-|X_{0,1}^{0,1}|\) of the messages from \(X_{1,0}^{0,1}\)to \(\omega\) and the rest to \(\omega^{\prime}\). Return \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\). 

**Proof of Correctness:**  Because of the previous discussion, if \(X_{0,1}^{1,0}\not=\emptyset\)or \(2k<n\), there is no solution. If \(|X_{0,1}^{0,1}|\geq k\) then, any input \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) that satisfies \(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\)\(\vec{\omega}\prec_{k}\vec{m}\prec_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\prime}\) would require to have at least \(|X_{0,1}^{0,1}|\) components equal to \(\omega\), which would break property (b). An analogous argument can be used when \(|X_{1,0}^{1,0}|>k\). If none of these conditions hold, then we set all messages from \(X_{0,1}^{0,1}\)to \(\omega\), all messages from \(X_{1,0}^{1,0}\)to \(\omega^{\prime}\), and we split the messages sent by senders in \(X_{1,0}^{0,1}\)between \(\omega\) and \(\omega^{\prime}\) in such a way that no value appears more than \(k\) times. The resulting input satisfies properties (a) and (b). 

### Theorem 1, strong \(k\)-resilience 

The proof of Theorem 1 for strong \(k\)-resilience is analogous to the one of \(k\)-resilience in the previous section. The main difference is the definition of \(\prec_{k}\). In this case we say that two inputs \(\vec{m}\)\(\vec{m}\) and \(\vec{m}^{\prime}\)\(\vec{m}^{\prime}\)satisfy
