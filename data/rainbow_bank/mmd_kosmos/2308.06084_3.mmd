routines for integers on qubit systems (see section 6.4.5 by [18] and [19]). The logistic map is the function 

\[g(x)=\mu x(1-x)\qquad{\rm for}\ \ x\in[0,1].\] (6)  

The logistic map is sensitive to the parameter \(\mu\in[0,4]\)with range restricted so that iterates of the function remain in the unit interval. 

To create the associated oracle function \(f\) via equation 5, we restrict \(\mu\) to binary fractions with the same resolution as available on the quantum register used to store \(x\). In other words we chose \(\mu\)so that \(2^{n}\mu\) is an integer. 

In Figure 2 we show the result of iterating the oracle with oracle function generated by truncating the logistic \(20\)through 40 for \(n=6\)qubits (and \(N=2^{n}=64\)states). In Figure \(30\)through 50 with \(n=12\)qubits (corresponding to \(2^{n}=4096\)states). For both panels, the initial condition \(x_{0}=2^{n-1}\). The x axes show \(\mu\), controlling the logistic map and its truncated version. The y axes show iterate values \(f(x)/2^{n}\)so they lie within the unit interval. For both figures the initial condition is given by \(x_{0}=2^{n-1}\). 

The orbits of the logistic map are insensitive to the initial condition (excepting a small set which includes the initial condition \(x=0\)). For \(\mu<1\)all orbits approach \(x=0\). For \(1<\mu<3\)there is a single attracting fixed point. At \(\mu=3\)there is a bifurcation giving an attracting period 2 orbit for \(3.0<\mu\lesssim 3.45\). Subsequent bifurcations show the phenomenon known as _ period doubling_ . Despite a low number of qubits, the structure of the logistic map is present in the iterates shown in Figure 1, of the truncated function of equation 5. 

In Figure 2a for \(\mu\) near but below 3, the distributions of iterates is wider than at lower values of \(\mu\). For each value of \(\mu\), the iterates are close together but cycle between nearby values. When an orbit is periodic, we refer to it as a cycle. Maps can have computationally determined periods that are dependent on the precision of the arithmetic [9, 16]. We see this phenomenon here as iterates in the truncated map can cycle between nearby states for the same value of \(\mu\) giving iterates in the original map that approach a fixed point. For the logistic map, if \(\mu\) gives a periodic attractor, orbits from almost all initial conditions converge on to it. However, for the truncated map, at a given \(\mu\), almost all initial conditions will give orbits that enter periodic cycles with the same period, however the points in these different cycles may not all be identical. 

The sensitivity to initial condition of the period \(p\) of a cycle that an orbit enters is illustrated in more detail in Figure 3. We compute iterates of the oracle function (the orbits) for different values of initial condition \(x_{0}\) and control variable \(\mu\). All orbits eventually enter a periodic cycle. The index of the iteration where the cycle is entered we call \(k_{c}\). This number is referred to as the _ link_ _length_  by [16] and defined as 

\[k_{c}(x_{0})={\rm min}\{k|f^{k}(x_{0})=f^{k+p}(x_{0}){\rm\ for\ }k\geq 0\}.\] (7)  

where \(p\) is the period of the cycle that is entered. The median period of the cycle for different initial conditions is shown as a function of \(\mu\) in the top panels in Figure 3. The period of the cycle that an orbit enters is shown shown as an image and as a function of \(\mu\) (on the xaxis) and initial condition \(x_{0}\) on the y-axis in the second panels. In the third panels we plot the iterates after the cycle has been entered and with color set by the cycle period. The link length, or iteration number when the cycle is entered, \(k_{c}\) is shown as an image in the bottom panels. 

Due to truncation, the attracting orbits of \(f\) either remain in a single state or are periodic, even for values of \(\mu\) that would give chaotic orbits in the logistic map. For values of \(\mu\) that give chaotic orbits in the logistic map, the truncated map \(f\) could have a long period, with period sensitive to the truncation level, which is set by the number of qubits in the quantum registers. Figure 3b shows 

FIG. 2. The result of iterating the circuit shown in Figure 1 with a) \(n=6\)qubits (top) and b) \(n=12\)qubits (bottom). The oracle function is generated by truncating the logistic map and is given by equation 5. For both panels, the initial condition \(x_{0}=2^{n-1}\). In a) we iterate 20 times and then plot 20 iterates. The x-axis is restricted to \(\mu>2\). In b) we iterate 30 times and then plot 20 iterates. The x-axis range is restricted to \(\mu>2.7\)so as to better show the region with substructure. The iterates of the truncated logistic map display many properties of the logistic map.
