used as contingencies for payments. Despite the importance of this question and its relevance for analysis of contracting decisions, this part of the contracting procedure is less explored. 

Our paper has two broad implications. First, our methodology of thinking about likelihood ratios can be applied to other settings in which considerations of communication off the equilibrium path are important. In our setup, unlike other models of communication and information design, the design of information structure for the equilibrium level of effort affects off-path communication and the ability of the principal and the agent to capture surplus. This can arise in other settings with strategic information transmission and our method can be useful for that. 

Second, our paper ties the choice of indicators in contracting to the bargaining power of the parties. In the textbook moral hazard problem, principal makes a take-it-or-leave it offer. As a result, a version of the informativeness principle often holds; the principal wishes to use all the information available, if possible, as contingency for payments. In contrast, in our model, the agent has different incentives for choice of indicators. There are some casual observations that are in line with this explanation. For example, contracts in NFL are often extremely detailed and payments to football players are highly contingent on various measures of individual and team outcomes. In contrast, contracts found in the English Premier League are not as detailed. They are often contingent on very coarse personal outcomes such as the number of goals scored reaching a particular threshold. In light of our theory, the level of competition in English/European soccer (in the form of increased player bargaining power) compared to a lack thereof in NFL could be behind this observation. Future work can hopefully shed light on the importance of this channel in the data.
