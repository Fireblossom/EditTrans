We extend the network coordination game to include global effects as follows. Given player \(i\), and a profile \(a_{-i}\) of actions of other players in the network, let \(p_{i}(a_{-i})=\frac{1}{I-d_{i}-1}\sum_{j\not\in N_{i}\cup\{i\}}a_{j}\) be the fraction of the network (not including \(i\) or neighbors of \(i\)\(1\). Player \(i\) gets some additional benefit \(1\)that depends positively on this aggregate proportion. This is formalized by a (weakly) increasing function \(\varphi_{i}:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}_{+}\) such that payoff to player \(i\)\(1\)is given by \(u_{i}(1,a_{-i})=\sum_{j\in N_{i}}w_{i,j}\hat{u}_{i}(1,a_{j})+\varphi_{i}(p_{i} (a_{-i}))\)with the natural normalization that \(\varphi_{i}(0)=0\). When convenient, we suppress the notation \(a_{-i}\) in \(p_{i}(a_{-i})\). 

In a ** network coordination game with local and global effects**  payoff of each player \(i\) is given by \(u_{i}(1,a_{-i})=\sum_{j\in N_{i}}w_{i,j}\hat{u}_{i}(1,a_{j})+\varphi_{i}(p_{i} (a_{-i}))\), and \(u_{i}(0,a_{-i})=0\), where \(\varphi_{i}:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}_{+}\) is a (weakly) increasing function with \(\varphi_{i}(0)=0\). Notice that a network coordination game with local and global effects is a game with strategic complements, because payoff of each player satisfies increasing differences: \(u_{i}(1,a_{-i})-u_{i}(0,a_{-i})\)is (weakly) increasing in \(a_{-i}\). Indeed, this holds for a (weakly) increasing function of the form \(\varphi_{i}(a_{-i})\), without composing with \(p_{i}(a_{-i})\), and our results hold for this generalization. We use \(p_{i}(a_{-i})\)to aid intuition for global effects. Moreover, it follows immediately that a network coordination game with local effects is the special case when each \(\varphi_{i}\) is identically zero. Our formulation is more general than assuming a weight \(w_{i,j}\geq 0\)for each non-neighbor \(j\) of \(i\). 

With heterogeneous local and global effects, \(1\)** is a best response of player** \(i\)**, if, and only if,** \(u_{i}(1,a_{-i})\geq u_{i}(0,a_{-i})\)**, which holds exactly when** \(\frac{s_{i}}{w_{i}}\geq q-\frac{\varphi_{i}(p_{i})}{w_{i}(b+c)}\), where \(s_{i}\) and \(q\) are as above. As \(\varphi_{i}\)\(1\)before \(i\)switches to \(1\)decreases in \(p_{i}\). In other words, with global effects, a smaller fraction of a given player’s neighbors need to \(1\)as compared to the case with local effects only. In this sense, global effects reduce network resilience to contagion. 

To ensure that the threshold fraction \(q-\frac{\varphi_{i}(p_{i})}{w_{i}(b+c)}\)is nonnegative (that is, global effects alone do not make \(1\)strictly dominant for player \(i\)), it is necessary and sufficient that \(\varphi_{i}(p_{i})\leq cw_{i}\). We impose this constraint going forward. There are no other restrictions on \(\varphi_{i}\) in terms of continuity, differentiability, concavity, convexity, and so on. 

When \(\varphi_{i}\) is identically zero, the condition \(\frac{s_{i}}{w_{i}}+\frac{\varphi_{i}(p_{i})}{w_{i}(b+c)}\geq q\), specializes to \(\frac{s_{i}}{w_{i}}\geq q\), and with equal and unit weights to \(\frac{s_{i}}{d_{i}}\geq q\) as in the earlier literature. With global effects, there is an additional contribution of \(b\) and \(c\) in a player’s decision, as shown in the term \(\frac{\varphi_{i}(p_{i})}{w_{i}(b+c)}\). In this case, considering a reduced form \(q\)alone is not sufficient to analyze the model, because there is an indeterminacy among the infinitely many \(b\)and \(c\) that yield the same \(q\). Without loss of generality, we adopt a normalization to address this by fixing \(c\) to be a positive constant throughout the paper, and considering the one-to-one mapping \(b\mapsto q=\frac{c}{b+c}\). Intuitively, this normalization fixes miscoordination cost at some baseline value \(c>0\)(for example, \(c=1\)) and coordination benefit \(b\) is measured relative to baseline cost. 

Our model includes complementarities in several parameters in a natural manner. The condition \(u_{i}(1,a_{-i})\geq u_{i}(0,a_{-i})\)can be written equivalently as \(\frac{s_{i}(a_{-i})}{w_{i}}+\frac{\varphi_{i}(p_{i}(a_{-i}))}{w_{i}c}q\geq q\) and further as \(\frac{cs_{i}(a_{-i})}{cw_{i}-\varphi_{i}(p_{i}(a_{-i}))}-q\geq 0\).
