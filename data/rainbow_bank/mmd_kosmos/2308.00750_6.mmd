Simulated (a)  and (b) \(\mathcal{N}\) values for the ibm_perth processor over a range of free evolution times \(t_{1}\)and \(t_{2}\). 

some metric  \(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X})\)\(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X})\)relies on the assumption that the relative frequency of the measured  \(\hat{X}\)\(\hat{X}\) is representative of the underlying distribution which  \(\hat{X}\)\(\hat{X}\) is drawn from. In our case,  \(\hat{X}\)\(\hat{X}\) is a measured set of shot probabilities, which may look something like \(\{\)00 : 0.7773,  10 : 0.1738,  01 : 0.0421,  11 : 0.0068 \(\}\), where, 00 for example corresponds to the probability of getting the plus state in both measurements at \(B\) and \(C\). We resample 8000 shots from a multinomial distribution with these underlying relative frequencies, over 1000 trials, creating a set of bootstrapped results  \(\hat{X}_{i}\)\(\hat{X}_{i}\). The simulated distribution of the metric of interest is then evaluated as  \(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X}_{i})\)\(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X}_{i})\)and twice the standard deviation of this distribution is used to calculate the 95% credible interval of the reported metric \(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X})\)\(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X})\). This technique is designed to account for shot noise in the finite-sample estimates of observables, and does not account for systematic error at the hardware level (gate miscalibration, readout misclassification). Finally, we rely on bias correction in the bootstrapping process; the sample mean of the metric  \(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X}_{i})\)\(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X}_{i})\)was in general not equal to the measured  \(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X})\)\(\hat{\theta}(\hat{X})\)(sometimes outside of the credible interval). 

### Simulated process 

In both platforms used, the qubit we probe belongs to a larger multi-qubit array. The particular qubits we choose each have one nearest-neighbour qubit, with which they are directly coupled, as well as additional distant qubits (two or more degrees of separation), with which interactions will be weaker. We therefore take the simplest model of our environment to be that of the single coupled qubit, as shown in Fig.  4 . This interaction can be described by the Hamiltonian [ 58 ] 

\[H=\frac{\omega_{1}}{2}(\mathds{1}\otimes\sigma_{z})+\frac{\omega_{2}}{2}( \sigma_{z}\otimes\mathds{1})+g_{12}(\sigma_{+}\otimes\sigma_{-}+\sigma_{-} \otimes\sigma_{+}),\] (7)  

where \(\omega_{1,2}\) are the resonance frequencies of the system and memory qubit, respectively, and \(\sigma_{+,-}\)are the creation and annihilation operators, respectively. Then the free evolution of system-memory is expressed as \(U=\exp{-iHt}\), where \(t\) is the time of the evolution. 

To write the process matrix for our system, we start with writing the terms: the initial state of the environment \(\rho^{E_{1}}\), the channel \(T_{1}^{A_{O}E_{1}^{T}B_{I}E2}\)and the second chan

nel \(T_{2}^{B_{O}E_{2}^{T}C_{I}E_{3}}\)(see Fig  4 ), where the superscript \(T\) on a system denotes partial transposition for that system. To obtain the process matrix, we combine the terms and trace out all the environment systems 

\[W=\text{Tr}_{E_{1},E_{2},E_{3}}(\rho^{E_{1}}\otimes T_{1}^{A_{O}E_{1}^{T}B_{I} E2}\otimes T_{2}^{B_{O}E_{2}^{T}C_{I}E_{3}}),\] (8)  

where \(\rho^{E_{1}}=|{0}\rangle\)because all qubits on the chip are initialised to the ground state, \(T_{1}^{A_{O}E_{1}B_{I}E2}=[[U]]^{A_{O}E_{1}B_{I}E2}\)and \(T_{2}^{B_{O}E_{2}^{T}C_{I}E_{3}}=[[U]]^{B_{O}E_{2}C_{I}E_{3}}\), and \([[U]]\)is the Choi form of \(U\), without the partial transposition. 

_Choi matrix definition:_  The Choi matrix \(M^{A_{I}A_{O}}\in{\cal L}({\cal H}^{A_{I}}\otimes{\cal H}^{A_{O}})\), isomorphic to a CP map \({\cal M}^{A}:{\cal L}({\cal H}^{A_{I}})\rightarrow{\cal L}({\cal H}^{A_{O}})\)is defined as MAI‚Å¢AO:=[‚Ñê‚äó‚Ñ≥(|ùüô‚ü©‚ü©‚ü®‚ü®ùüô|ùüô)]T, where \(\cal I\) is the identity map, |ùüô‚ü©‚ü©=‚àëj=1dAI|jj‚ü©‚àà‚ÑãAI‚äó‚ÑãAI, \(\{|{j}\rangle\}^{d_{A_{I}}}_{j=1}\)is an orthonormal basis on \({\cal H}^{A_{I}}\)and \({T}\) denotes matrix transposition in that basis and some basis of \({\cal H}^{A_{O}}\). 

We see that the free evolution, U, depends on the parameters of the Hamiltonian, \(\omega_{1}\), \(\omega_{2}\), \(g_{1,2}\), and the time \(t\). Hence, our process matrix will also depend on these parameters, \(W(\omega_{1},\omega_{2},g_{1,2},t_{1},t_{2})\). To simulate the process on uq, experimental parameters were measured to be as given in Table  II , and we scan \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\) from 85 to 115 ns, capturing the 97 ns process conducted in the experiment. For the process on ibm_perth, the parameters were fixed at the values available in Table  III , and we scan \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\) between 17 and 33 ns, capturing the permutations of \(t_{1}=[21.33,24.89,28.44]\)ns and \(t_{2}=[21.33,24.89,28.44]\)ns conducted in experiment. The ibm_perth process simulation yielded the results in Fig.  5 . 

\(\sqrt{JSD}\)

According to these results, the experimental runs where evolution times are \(t_{1}=t_{2}=24.89\)ns should maximise both metrics of non-Markovianity on ibm_perth, while other settings ( \(t_{1}=21.33\)ns and \(t_{2}=28.44\)ns) should be close to fully suppressing non-Markovian dynamics. In practice, both metrics were observed to be smeared across the free evolution times scanned. This is not a particularly surprising result when contrasting the simplicity of the coupled-qubit environment described in Eq.  7  to the complexity of current-day quantum hard
