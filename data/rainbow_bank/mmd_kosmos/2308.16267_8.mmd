frequencies. In such a symmetry-breaking sense, the the principal transition also belongs to the Landau class of transition. Also, in the Landau theory the energy is expressed as a functional of some order parameters. We leave the discussion in terms of variational energy as a functional of the order parameters in symmetry breaking around the transition in Appendix  A . 

### Key for reconciliation of the two contrary transition classes: Unbroken higher symmetry 

We have seen at \(g_{c}^{(0,1)}\)the simultaneous occurrence of the topological class of transition and the Landau class of transition which are conventionally incompatible due to opposite symmetry requirements. The key for their simultaneous occurrence or coexistence essentially lies in the reconcilable situation that the symmetry which the topological class of transition preserves is actually different from the symmetries which the Landau class of transition breaks. Indeed, the symmetry that protects the topological feature of the spin winding for the eigenstates in the transitions is the parity symmetry  \(\hat{P}\)\(\hat{P}\), which comprises both the space inversion and the spin reversal 

\[\hat{P}=\hat{P}_{x}\hat{P}_{\sigma}.\] (55)  \[\hat{P}=\hat{P}_{x}\hat{P}_{\sigma}.\] (55)  

As mentioned in Sect.  II , the \(g_{y}\) term in the coupling is effectively the Rashba spin-orbit coupling or equal-weight mixture of the linear Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit couplings [ 28 – 31 ], which involves the spin nontrivially and drives the spin winding. The parity symmetry guarantees the symmetric spin texture in ( 29 ) and its connection at the two infinity ends in the position variation, which establishes the symmetry situation for the TPTs. Note both before and after the transition \(g_{c}^{(0,1)}\)this parity symmetry that atcually protects all the TPTs is still preserved 

\[\hat{P}\psi_{0}\left(x\right) = -\psi_{0}\left(x\right),\] (56) \[\hat{P}\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right) = \pm\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right),\] (57)  \[\hat{P}\psi_{0}\left(x\right) = -\psi_{0}\left(x\right),\] (56) \[\hat{P}\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right) = \pm\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right),\] (57)  

\[\hat{P}\psi_{0}\left(x\right) = -\psi_{0}\left(x\right),\] (56) \[\hat{P}\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right) = \pm\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right),\] (57)  \[\hat{P}\psi_{0}\left(x\right) = -\psi_{0}\left(x\right),\] (56) \[\hat{P}\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right) = \pm\psi_{n}^{\left(z,\eta\right)}\left(x\right),\] (57)  

even when the subsymmetries in the space inversion and the spin reversal are both broken. Therefore, the conventionally opposite symmetry requirements for the Landau class and topological class of phase transitions reconcile each other here and we see the simultaneous occurrence or coexistence of the two contrary transition classes. 

## UNDERSTANDING UNCONVENTIONAL TOPOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF COUNTER-ROTATING TERM 

Most TPTs in the anisotropic QRM are conventional ones [ 28 ] which occur with gap closing as those in condensed matter [ 91 ,  96 – 101 ]. Unconventional TPTs without gap closing also exist [ 29 ,  30 ] analogously to the unconventional cases in the quantum spin Hall effect with 

strong electron-electron interactions [ 102 ] and the quantum anomalous Hall effect with disorder [ 103 ]. These unconventional TPTs lie in the ground state by a mechanism of node introduction from the infinity [ 29 ,  30 ]. On the other hand, it is found that unconventional TPTs emerge more frequently in excited states, especially around level anti-crossings [ 31 ]. Here from the JC-Stark model we can gain some insight for the origin of such unconventional TPTs in excited states. 

In Fig.  6  panel (a) shows the energy spectrum of the JC-Stark model, where levels are crossing among the all states with negative parity (blue solid) and positive parity (red dotted). Panel (b) gives the spin winding number \(n_{w}\) (solid line) of the ground state ( \(j_{E}=1\)) which jumps always at parity variation (dotted line) and gap closing (similar to the solid line in panel (f)). The spin winding can turn direction in excited states, as indicated by the negative values of \(n_{w}\) in panel (d) for state \(j_{E}=20\)according to the discussion in Sect. IV G . Each jump of \(n_{w}\) is accompanied with a TPT. In particular, some TPTs occur without parity variation, as illustrated in panel (e) for state \(j_{E}=2,\) which comes from the level crossing between same parity states. Note here the gap is sill closing at the transitions despite no parity variation. What interesting is, once we add anisotropy, e.g. \(\lambda=0.01\), the gap at these TPTs opens, as demonstrated by the energy spectrum by panel (b) and more clearly by the dotted line in panel (f). This gap opening accounts for the afore-mentioned unconventional TPTs in the excited. 

A clearer explanation can be given by regarding the counter-rotating term as a perturbation around these transitions which mainly involves the two level-crossing states \(\psi_{n}^{\left(x,\eta\right)},\psi_{n^{\prime}}^{\left(x,\eta^{\prime}\right)}\)with energies \(\varepsilon_{1}=E^{\left(n,\eta\right)}\), \(\varepsilon_{2}=E^{\left(n^{\prime},\eta^{\prime}\right)}\)and winding numbers \(n_{w,1}=-\eta n\), \(n_{w,2}=-\eta^{\prime}n^{\prime}\). On the basis of these two states the Hamiltonian in matrix form can be written as 

\[H\approx\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}E^{\left(n,\eta\right)}&d\\ d&E^{\left(n^{\prime},\eta^{\prime}\right)}\end{array}\right)\] (58)  

where 

\[d=\langle\psi_{n}|H_{\lambda}|\psi_{n^{\prime}}\rangle = \lambda g\sqrt{n^{\prime}+1}\frac{C_{n\Uparrow}^{\left(\eta\right )}C_{n^{\prime}\Downarrow}^{\left(\eta^{\prime}\right)}}{\sqrt{N_{n}N_{n^{ \prime}}}}\delta_{n,n^{\prime}+2}\] (59) \[+\lambda g\sqrt{n^{\prime}-1}\frac{C_{n\Downarrow}^{\left(\eta \right)}C_{n^{\prime}\Uparrow}^{\left(\eta^{\prime}\right)}}{\sqrt{N_{n}N_{n^{ \prime}}}}\delta_{n,n^{\prime}-2}\]  

and \(H_{\lambda}\) is the counter-rotating term in ( 3 ) beyond the JC-Stark model. The crossing levels are split as \(E_{\pm}=\frac{1}{2}(E^{\left(n,\eta\right)}+E^{\left(n^{\prime},\eta^{\prime} \right)}\pm\Delta)\)with a gap opening at the levelcrossing point \(E^{\left(n,\eta\right)}=E^{\left(n^{\prime},\eta^{\prime}\right)},\)

\[\Delta=\sqrt{(E^{\left(n,\eta\right)}-E^{\left(n^{\prime},\eta^{\prime}\right) })^{2}+4d^{2}}\to 2|d|,\] (60)  

which is finite for \(n=n^{\prime}\pm 2\), leading to the level anticrossing. The validity of Eq. ( 60 ) is confirmed by the
