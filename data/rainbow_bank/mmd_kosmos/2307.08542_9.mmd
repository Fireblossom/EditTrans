de Finetti and many other authors who wrote on bookmaking, assumed additivity more or less implicitly 4 4 The bookmaking argument usually makes yet stronger assumptions by also incorporating positive scalar but emphasized the importance of monotonicity. They used the above multiplications and, thus, linear combinations. We showed that such assumptions are not needed because result, without the antimonotonicity restriction, and several variations, to argue that it is they are implied by the other conditions. rational to use subjective probabilities in the context of uncertainty. Linearity of utility, as implied here, is reasonable for moderate stakes ( l’Haridon & Vieider ,  2019 , p. 189;  Savage , 1954 , p. 91). de Finetti’s result was historically important as a foundation of Bayesianism. Our result shows, again, that the most critical case of “bookmaking” occurs when there are maximal possibilities of hedging (antimonotonicity). That is, de Finetti needed to defend his condition only for antimonotonic cases. 

### Anscombe and Aumann’s subjective expected utility 

Anscombe & Aumann  ( 1963 ) presented a famous preference axiomatization of expected utility. ** ?** 

 ( 1970 ,  § 13.1) proposed a simplified version of their framework that is most popular today and we will use that. It is important because it is mostly used as point of departure for developing ambiguity theories ( § 4.3 ). The outcome set \({\cal C}\) is nowadays often chosen to be a mixture space, and so will we do. Examples of mixture spaces include money intervals, convex subsets of linear spaces, or, the most common case in the literature on ambiguity, probability distributions over general “prizes.” For simplicity, readers not familiar with general mixture spaces may take in mind any such example. 

We call \({\cal C}\) a _ mixture space_  if it is endowed with a mixture operation. A _ mixture operation_ generalizes convex combinations on linear spaces. It maps \({\cal C}\times[0,1]\times{\cal C}\) to \({\cal C}\), and is denoted \(\alpha x+(1-\alpha)y\). It is required to satisfy the following conditions: 

\(1x+0y=x\) (identity); \(\alpha x+(1-\alpha)y=(1-\alpha)y+\alpha x\) (commutativity); \(\alpha(\beta x+(1-\beta)y)+(1-\alpha)y=\alpha\beta x+(1-\alpha\beta)y\) (associativity). 

A function \(U:{\cal C}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is  if 

\[\textnormal{for~{}all~{}outcomes~{}}x,y,\textnormal{~{}and~{}}0<\alpha<1:~{}U( \alpha x+(1-\alpha)y)=\alpha U(x)+(1-\alpha)U(y).\] (6)
