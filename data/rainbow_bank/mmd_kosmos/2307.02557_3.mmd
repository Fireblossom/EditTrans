from what Einstein’s General Relativity predicts. This signature _ squeezes_  classical-quantum theories of gravity from both sides: if one has shorter decoherence times for superpositions of different mass distributions, one necessarily has more diffusion of the gravitational metric. One can thus use Cavendish-type experiments to upper bound the amount of diffusion, and coherence experiments to lower bound it, thus squeezing the parameter space of the theory from both sides. The decoherence-diffusion trade-off, therefore, provides a way of testing CQ theories: one lower bounds the amount of diffusion the theory must have from coherence experiments, which can then be tested by measuring the noise in precision mass experiments. 

The present work aims to study the weak field limit of classical-quantum theories of general relativity and to provide a series of kernels that characterise correlations in the stochastic dynamics. From these, theorists and experimentalists can choose to develop and test the parameter space of CQ theories. In the main body, we do so in two different ways. We construct the Newtonian limit of both the path CQ general relativistic path integral of [ 33 ] and of the master equation from [ 22 ]. The master equation is then unraveled in the form of coupled Langevin stochastic differential equations for the classical gravitational field and the quantum state of matter. In order to do so, we first identify the relevant degree of freedom as being the Newtonian potential in a non-relativistic setting. To corroborate our results, in [ 37 ], we verify our approach by comparing it to a diffeomorphism invariant CQ theory of scalar gravity, which gives the correct Newtonian limit. 

If such theories are in violation of experiments, this will provide an indirect test for the quantum nature of gravity. In [ 35 ], the decoherence diffusion trade-off was used to rule out a large class of natural theories that we derive here, namely those which are ultra-local, nonrelativistic and continuous in the classical phase space. Hence, an important problem is to study and classify consistent classical-quantum theories of gravity, and their low energy limit, in order to further squeeze the parameter space of physically sensible CQ theories. 

Moving away from fundamentally classical fields, we also mention that CQ theories of gravity could describe an effective regime of quantum gravity whenever the gravitational field freedom behaves classically. In this case, we expect that variants of the master equation and path integral we find here will be useful in describing this limit. However, an effective theory will be non-Markovian in some regimes, meaning that the decoherence-diffusion trade-off will not need to hold for all times [ 22 ]. Lastly, given that we are discussing a semiclassical model of Newtonian gravity, in the discussion we compare and contrast our results with those of [ 26 – 28 ,  38 ,  39 ]. Here, we can arrive at the master equation formulation and path-integral, from a reduction of the degrees of freedom of a fully relativistic theory. We find that our weak-field limit shares some features of [ 26 – 28 ,  39 ], but differs from them in several ways. 

Let us now summarize our main results and present the outline of the paper. 

### Summary of results 

Section  2 : We start by recapping the CQ theory framework in its most general form. We explain how the state of the system is given by a hybrid CQ state \(\varrho(z)\)that can be evolved either through a path integral ( 4.2 ), which was introduced in [ 33 ,  40 ], via a master equation
