We then proceed to disentangle the coherent dynamics and the associated lifetimes of each component. For this, we perform the data analysis of the residuals by fitting exponentially decaying harmonic functions in order to extract the oscillation frequencies and the lifetime of the coherences. The detailed fitting functions and procedures are shown in the SI. We first show the residuals of the cross peak “X” in Fig. 4(a) as blue square dots. We start our fitting procedure with the resolved oscillatory frequencies: 122, 250 and 345 cm _-1_. We then assign the initial values of the lifetime to be 300 fs with the guessed range from 0 to infinity. All the fitting procedures were performed using the Curve fitting Toolbox (Matlab2021(b)). We finalize the fitting results with the R-square \(>\)0.97. They are shown as red solid line in Fig. 4(a). The green shadow indicates the boundary of the confidence interval of 95%. By this, we are able to separate the electronic coherence from vibrational coherence. The coordinates of cross peak “X” ( \(\omega_{\tau}\), \(\omega_{t}\)) = (14812, 14690) cm _-1_reveal the energy gap of 122 cm _-1_in the 2D electronic spectra. The matching of the resolved frequency of this mode and the energy gap manifests that the oscillatory dynamics of 122 cm _-1_corresponds to the electronic quantum coherence. Moreover, theoretical calculations and the representation transformation from the site to the exciton basis reveal that the cross peak “X” mainly originates from the transition between \(\rm Chl_{D1}\) and \(\rm Pheo_{D1}\). Thus, this oscillatory component of 122 cm _-1_(magenta solid line in Fig. 4(a)) reveals the electronic coherence between \(\rm Chl_{D1}\) and \(\rm Pheo_{D1}\). It shows the lifetime of 180 fs, which perfectly agrees with the lifetime retrieved from the theoretical modeling and the calculations discussed in the next section. In addition, we also resolve the vibrational coherence of frequencies 250 and 345 cm _-1_(black and green dashed lines in Fig. 4(a)). They have the lifetimes of 527 and 829 fs, respectively.
