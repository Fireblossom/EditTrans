take place before a magic state becomes a stabilizer state [ 21 ,  32 ]. The relative entropy of magic, the stabilizer fidelity, and the generalized robustness of magic are instances of magic monotones based on a quantum relative entropy and can be defined for any resource theory. A fundamental problem is whether the magic monotones based on a quantum relative entropy are additive under tensor products, and if not, under which conditions they become additive. However, very little is known about the additivity properties of these monotones. Besides its theoretical interest, the latter property is practically useful since it allows us to reduce the computation of the magic resource of the ‘whole’ to just the sum of one of the ‘parts’. The computation of these monotones becomes soon unfeasible for multi-qubit states as the number of qubits grows. This is because the number of pure stabilizer states scales super-exponentially with the number of qubits. For numerical experiments, we are limited to just five-qubit states [ 19 ,  32 ]. The additivity property allows us to overcome this problem for tensor products of low-dimensional multi-qubit states. In this case, the total magic resource just equals the sum of the one of each state, which is computable. 

The additivity property allows us to compute upper bounds for state transformations. In particular, we can obtain upper bounds for the ratio \(m/k\) in the transformation \(\rho^{\otimes k}\rightarrow\sigma^{\otimes m}\)under free operations. Moreover, the results on the relative entropy of magic allow us to derive upper bounds for asymptotic state transformation. In this way, we obtain much tighter bounds for one-shot state transformation than the one previously known, which used the generalized robustness. Moreover, we obtain new (closed-form) upper bounds for transformations involving specific two and three-qubit mixed states, e.g. the depolarized Toffoli state (see Section  6  for more details). 

We now summarize the main results of this work. 


*  In Section  3 , we prove that the stabilizer fidelity is multiplicative for tensor products of any number of single-qubit states. We then extend this result to include a continuous set of magic monotones, namely all the \(\alpha\)\(z\) R´enyi relative entropies of magic in the range \(|(1-\alpha)/z|=1\). In this way, we also independently recover the multiplicativity of the generalized robustness of magic for all single-qubit states established in [ 32 ]. 


*  In Section  4 , we prove that the relative entropy of magic is additive for single-qubit states if all of them but one commute with their optimizer, i.e. the closest stabilizer state. Moreover, in Section  8 , we show that the latter class includes the \(T\), \(H\), and \(F\) states subject to depolarizing noise. These are the states involved in the standard magic state distillation scenario where any initial state is first projected onto a symmetry axis of the octahedron by applying the stabilizer twirling, from which one aims to distill a better pure magic state [ 7 ,  8 ]. We extend this result to all the \(\alpha\)\(z\) R´enyi relative entropies of magic. Finally, we also show that the relative entropy of magic is not additive for general two multi-qubit states by providing a counterexample. 


*  In Section  5 , we prove that all the \(\alpha\)\(z\) R´enyi relative entropies of magic are additive for two and three-qubit states that belong to a specific class. In Section  8 , we show that the latter class includes the Toffoli, Hoggar, and \(CS\) states subject to global depolarizing noise. 


*  In Section  6  we discuss in detail the implication of the above additivity results to magic state transformation. This allows us to obtain upper bounds on magic state distillation and dilution. 


*  In Section  7 , we give closed-form expressions for the stabilizer fidelity and the generalized robustness of magic for single-qubit states. The latter monotone benchmarks several proposed classical simulators (see [ 32 ] for more details). Moreover, for single-qubit states, the generalized robustness of magic is equal to the dyadic negativity and the mixed-state extent [ 32 , Theorem 3]. In Section  8  we give a closed-form expression for all the \(\alpha\)\(z\) R´enyi relative entropies of magic for \(T,H,F\), Toffoli, Hoggar, and \(CS\) magic states subject to global depolarizing noise.
