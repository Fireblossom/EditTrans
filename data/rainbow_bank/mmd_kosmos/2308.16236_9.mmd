\(C_{+}^{123}\)

\[C_{GMC}=\] 3⁢C+123y⁢(1−y)[y⁢(1−y) −3y(1−(3⁢C+1232⁢y⁢(1−y))2/3)3/2]. (47)  



By empirically determining \(C_{+}^{123}\)at appropriate instants while the initial state ( 43 ) evolves in the relevant damping channel, and using the above relation ( 47 ) to evaluate the corresponding \(C_{GMC}\), one can therefore empirically verify the prediction of ESD occurring at the instant fixed by Eq.( 45 ) corresponding to a given value of the parameter y of the initially prepared state of the form specified by Eq. ( 43 ). 

Next, we observe that it is possible to empirically verify the predicted ESD for the initial state ( 43 ) by also using Mutual Information (MI) with respect to the \(\sigma_{X}\times\sigma_{X}\times\sigma_{X}\) basis ( \(I_{X}\)) and Mutual Predictability (MP) with respect to the \(\sigma_{Z}\times\sigma_{Z}\times\sigma_{Z}\) basis ( \(P_{Z}\)). In these cases, for the time evolution of the state ( 43 ) in the same damping channel as considered earlier, we show by numerical computation the monotonic relationship between \(C_{GMC}\) and \(I_{X}\), \(P_{Z}\) respectively, illustrated by the plots in 

the Figs. Fig. 7  and Fig. 8  respectively, taking the value of the state parameter \(y=0.5\). Therefore, by empirically determining \(I_{X}\) or \(P_{Z}\) it is also possible to empirically verify the prediction of ESD according to Eq. ( 45 ). 

## DISCUSSION 

Recently, statistical correlators got significant attention for characterizing the bipartite entanglement. However, till now no work has been done in the direction of characterizing tripartite entanglement using statistical correlators. In this paper, we start by defining statistical correlators in the multipartite system. Our definitions are consistent with the fact that whenever these tripartite states are product states or bi-separable, the measure should be zero. Using this definition, we have calculated statistical correlators for a few classes of pure tripartite 

FIG. 5. From the plot it is clear that \(C_{GMC}\) and \(F_{123}\) is not monotonically related to each other.The maxima of \(C_{GMC}\)and the maxima of \(F_{123}\) occurs at different \(a\). We have plotted \(C_{GMC}\) and \(I_{X}\) with \(t/\tau\) at \(y=0.5\). From the plot, it is clear that they are monotonic i.e. they have the same functional behavior. Hence, using \(I_{X}\) we can experimentally show the sudden death of entanglement. 

FIG. 6. From the plot we can see that \(C^{123}_{X}\)is monotonically related to GMC and \(C^{123}_{+}\)is monotonically related to triangle measure. \(C^{123}_{X}\)and \(C_{GMC}\) has the same functional behavior with \(a\), so if we know \(C^{123}_{X}\)then we can calculate \(C_{GMC}\) . Similarly, if we know \(C^{123}_{+}\)then we can calculate \(F_{123}\). We have plotted \(C_{GMC}\) and \(P_{Z}\) with \(t/\tau\) at \(y=0.5\). From the plot, it is clear that they are monotonic i.e. they have the same functional behavior. Hence, using \(P_{Z}\) we can experimentally show the sudden death of entanglement.
