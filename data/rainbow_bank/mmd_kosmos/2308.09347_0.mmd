# ENDOWMENTS, PATIENCE TYPES, AND UNIQUENESS IN TWO-GOOD HARA UTILITY ECONOMIES ANDREA LOI AND STEFANO MATTA 

##### Abstract.
Abstract.  This paper establishes a link between endowments, patience types, and the parameters of the HARA Bernoulli utility function that ensure equilibrium uniqueness in an economy with two goods and two impatience types with additive separable preferences. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee uniqueness of equilibrium for any possible value of \(\gamma\) in the HARA utility function \(\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\left(b+\frac{a}{\gamma}x\right)^{1-\gamma}\). The analysis contributes to the literature on uniqueness in pure exchange economies with two-goods and two agent types and extends the result in [4].

## 1.  Introduction 

The relationship between risk aversion, the number of consumer types \(I\) and the uniqueness of the equilibrium price has been analysed in a recent article [4]. More precisely, in an economy with two goods and an arbitrary number \(I\) of impatience types, where each type has additive separable preferences with a HARA Bernoulli utility function \(u_{H}(x):=\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\left(b+\frac{a}{\gamma}x\right)^{1-\gamma}\), it has been shown that the equilibrium is unique if the parameter \(\gamma\) is in the range \(\left(1,\frac{I}{I-1}\right]\). 

While it is well known [2, 5, 6] the effect on uniqueness when \(\gamma\) takes a value between \(0\)and \(1\)(in the case \(\gamma=1\)the function becomes logarithmic), it is not known what conditions ensure uniqueness when \(\gamma\)\(2\). In this perspective, [4] analysed only the particular case when \(\gamma=3\)and \(I=2\), and found sufficient conditions that ensure uniqueness. 

It is a natural question to ask whether a similar result can be found outside the above interval. More specifically, this would mean finding sufficient conditions that guarantee uniqueness of the equilibrium for any value of the \(\gamma\) parameter. This is related to [1]â€™s remarks on the difficulty of finding a sufficient condition, expressible in closed form, that would allow, for DARA-type utilities, the introduction of more heterogeneity among agents in order to overcome the restrictive assumption of identical endowments to ensure uniqueness (see [1, Proposition 2]).
