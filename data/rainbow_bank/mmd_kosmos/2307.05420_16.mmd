A remarkable demonstration of random graphs that generalizes the proposed approach is the transferability of the parameters from 6-node random graphs (at the subgraph level) to 64-node random graphs, as shown in Figure 6. The approximation ratio loss of only 1â€“2% was observed in all three cases. Furthermore, we demonstrated that one need not increase the size of the donor graph to achieve high transferability, even for acceptor graphs with 256 nodes. 

Following the subgraph decomposition approach, we showed that one can determine good transferability between donor-acceptor graph pairs by exploiting their similarity based on parity. We see a good correlation between subgraph similarity and parity similarity. In the future, we wish to address the exploitation of graph structure to determine good donor candidates, since subgraph similarities involve overhead calculations of QAOA energies for each pair of donor-acceptor subgraphs. 

One may notice that we studied parameter transferability only for \(p=1\), where the subgraphs are small and transferability is straightforward. However, our preliminary work suggests that this technique will also work for larger \(p\), which will require advanced subgraph exploration algorithms and will be addressed in our following work. In particular, we wish to explore the idea of generating a large database of donor graphs and, together with a graph-embedding technique, obtain optimal QAOA parameters for transferability. We hope that by training a good graph-embedding model, we will be able to apply our technique to various sets of graphs and extend our approach to larger depths. A machine learning approach has been used to determine optimal QAOA parameters [Khairy et al., 2020], but a study of machine learning for donor graph determination is still an open question. 

Another future direction is to determine whether the effects of parity of a graph hold for \(p>1\). In particular, we found that the parity of a graph affects the distribution of optimal parameters, as shown in Figs. 11 and 18. It remains to be seen whether parameters concentrate for \(p>1\) and, if so, how parity affects their distribution. Analysis of these trends will be critical for the applicability of \(PS\) for \(p>1\). 

This work was enabled by the very fast and efficient tensor network simulator QTensor developed at Argonne National Laboratory [Lykov et al., 2021]. Unlike state vector simulators, QTensor can perform energy calculations for most instances with \(p\leqslant 3\), \(d\leqslant 6\) and graphs with \(N\sim\!1,000\) nodes very quickly, usually within seconds. For this work we computed QAOA energy for 64-node graphs with \(d\leqslant 5\) at \(p=1\), a calculation that took a fraction of a second per each execution on a personal computer. With state vector simulators, however, even such calculations would not have been possible because of the prohibitive memory requirements for storing the state vector. 

As a result of this work, finding optimized parameters for some QAOA instances will become quick and efficient, removing this major bottleneck in the QAOA approach and potentially removing the optimization step altogether in 

Figure 16: For an increasing number of donor graph nodes, we see that parity can determine good transferability. For the case with subgraph transferability, we see that this does not depend on the number of nodes of the donor graph.
