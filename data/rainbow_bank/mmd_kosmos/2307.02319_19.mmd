Whenever the context is clear, we will omit the arguments of \(k_{0}^{*}\), \(k_{1}^{*}\), \(r_{0}^{*}\), and \(r_{1}^{*}\). With the optimal \(r_{i}^{*}\)derived, it can be shown that a voter with costs \(\gamma_{i}\)receives an expected payoff from \(r=r^{*}_{1}\)that is at least as great as from \(r=r_{0}^{*}\)if and only if \[\gamma_{i}\leq k_{0}\cdot F(k_{0})+k_{1}\cdot(1-F(k_{1}))+t\cdot(F(k_{1})-F(k_ {0})).\]  Because the optimal rewards, \(r_{1}^{*}\)and \(r_{0}^{*}\), are characterized by the terms \(k_{1}\)and \(k_{0}\), we define the following term \(k_{i}^{*}\), which we refer to as individual \(i\)’s “optimal \(k\).” 

\[k_{i}^{*}=\begin{cases}k_{1}\,\,\,\text{ if }\gamma_{i}\leq k_{0}\cdot F(k_{0} )+k_{1}\cdot(1-F(k_{1}))+t\cdot(F(k_{1})-F(k_{0})),\\ k_{0}\,\,\,\text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}\] (11)  

The value \(k_{i}^{*}\)can be interpreted essentially as the optimal level of compliance, given \(i\)’s type, \(\gamma_{i}\), because \(F(k_{i}^{*})\) represents \(i\)’s optimal _ equilibrium prevalence_ . Individuals with \(k_{i}^{*}=k_{1}\)prefer higher prevalence (in equilibrium, _ i.e._ , after taking transfers and the distribution of others’ costs into account) than individuals with \(k_{i}^{*}=k_{0}\). We shall see that, in all equilibria with non-null algorithms, some individuals will “vote for” high compliance but ultimately not comply, or viceversa. We will return to this, but the point to note is that this seeming preference reversal will be solely a function of the individual in question being on the “losing side” of the majority vote over the ultimate reward. 

For any given pair \((k_{0}^{*},k_{1}^{*})\), Equation (11) defines a cut-point that divides individuals (in terms of their types) into “low cost” and “high cost” individuals — individuals with low enough costs will support the higher reward level, \(r_{1}^{*}\), and individuals with high costs will support the lower reward level, \(r_{0}^{*}\). Equation (11) also demonstrates, as claimed earlier, that support for the higher reward increases in the marginal value of the externality, \(t\). This is stated formally in the following proposition. 

**Proposition 6.** _ For any_ \(t\)_,_ \(F\)_, and_ \(\phi\)_, and any voter_ \(i\in N\)_,_ \[\bigg{[}\;k_{i}^{*}(t,F)=k_{1}^{*}(t,F)\;\text{ \emph{and} }\;t^{\prime}>t\; \bigg{]}\Rightarrow\;\;k_{i}^{*}(t^{\prime},F)=k_{1}^{*}(t^{\prime},F).\]  

With the comparative statics of individual incentives established, we now turn to the question of how rewards will be chosen democratically for any given classifier \(\delta\).
