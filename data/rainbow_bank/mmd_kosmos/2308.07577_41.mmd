This is true by referring to ( A17 )â€“( A18 ). In particular, by ( A16 ) and ( A19 ), 

\[\hat{\tilde{M}}=\tilde{m}(\hat{\tilde{Y}},\hat{\varepsilon})=m(\hat{Y},\hat{ \varepsilon})=\hat{M},\quad\tilde{p}(\tilde{x})=p(x)\quad\text{and}\quad\tilde {p}(\tilde{b})=p(b).\]  \[\hat{\tilde{M}}=\tilde{m}(\hat{\tilde{Y}},\hat{\varepsilon})=m(\hat{Y},\hat{ \varepsilon})=\hat{M},\quad\tilde{p}(\tilde{x})=p(x)\quad\text{and}\quad\tilde {p}(\tilde{b})=p(b).\]  

Furthermore,  \(\tilde{\Psi}(\tilde{y},\hat{\tilde{Y}})=\Psi(y,\hat{Y})\)\(\tilde{\Psi}(\tilde{y},\hat{\tilde{Y}})=\Psi(y,\hat{Y})\)by the definition in and 

\[\tilde{f}\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\delta}\tilde{\imath}(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y})+\hat{\tilde{Y}},\hat{\tilde{Y}}\right] =\tilde{f}\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\delta}\sigma i(x,y)+\mu+\sigma\hat{ Y},\hat{\tilde{Y}}\right]\] \[=\tilde{f}\left[\mu+\sigma\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\delta}i(x,y)+\hat{Y }\right),\hat{\tilde{Y}}\right]=f\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\delta}i(x,y)+\hat{Y},\hat {Y}\right].\]  

The above analysis implies that ( A20 ) holds. To see that ( A21 ) holds, note that 

\[x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y}) =\inf\left\{\mu+\sigma x\geq\mu-\frac{a\sigma}{d}:f(x,y)=0\right\}\] \[=\mu+\sigma\inf\left\{x\geq p^{-1}(0):f(x,y)=0\right\}=\mu+\sigma x _{f}(y),\]  

where we have used the definition of \(p\)and \(\tilde{p}\)\(\tilde{p}\). This yields 

\[\tilde{x}<x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})\iff x<x_{f}(y).\]  \[\tilde{x}<x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})\iff x<x_{f}(y).\]  

In combination with ( A18 ), we obtain 

\[\tilde{\imath}(\tilde{x},\tilde{y})=\sigma i(x,y)=\begin{cases}\sigma\left(x-p ^{-1}[f(x,y)]\right),&\tilde{x}<x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y}),\\ \sigma\left(x_{f}(y)-p^{-1}(0)\right),&\tilde{x}\geq x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y}). \end{cases}\]  \[\tilde{\imath}(\tilde{x},\tilde{y})=\sigma i(x,y)=\begin{cases}\sigma\left(x-p ^{-1}[f(x,y)]\right),&\tilde{x}<x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y}),\\ \sigma\left(x_{f}(y)-p^{-1}(0)\right),&\tilde{x}\geq x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y}). \end{cases}\]  

When \(\tilde{x}<x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})\)\(\tilde{x}<x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})\), using and the definition of \(p\)and \(\tilde{p}\)\(\tilde{p}\), we obtain 

\[\sigma\left(x-p^{-1}[f(x,y)]\right) =\sigma x-\sigma p^{-1}[\tilde{f}(\tilde{x},\tilde{y})]\] \[=\tilde{x}-\mu-\sigma\left(\frac{\tilde{f}(\tilde{x},\tilde{y})-a }{d}\right)=\tilde{x}-\tilde{p}^{-1}[\tilde{f}(\tilde{x},\tilde{y})].\]  

When \(\tilde{x}\geq x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})\)\(\tilde{x}\geq x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})\), using the definition of \(p\)and \(\tilde{p}\)\(\tilde{p}\) again yields 

\[\sigma\left(x_{f}(y)-p^{-1}(0)\right)=x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})- \mu+\frac{a\sigma}{d}=x_{\tilde{f}}(\tilde{y})-\tilde{p}^{-1}(0).\]  

The above analysis implies that ( A21 ) holds. Therefore, economies \(E\) and  \(\tilde{E}\)\(\tilde{E}\) generate the same commodity price process. 

## Algorithms 

The storage model is solved by a suitably modified version of the endogenous grid method of  Carroll  ( 2006 ). Recall the candidate space \(\mathscr{C}\)and \(\bar{p}_{f}(z)\)\(\bar{p}_{f}(z)\) defined in Appendix  A . We derive the following property in order to properly handle free-disposal and state-dependent discounting in the numerical computation.
