## Introduction 

Understanding the behavior of commodity prices is of critical importance given their role in many countries as determinants of balance of payments, exchange rates, tax revenue, output fluctuations, and inflation (see, e.g.,  Byrne et al. ,  2013 ;  Gospodinov and Ng ,  2013 ; Eberhardt and Presbitero ,  2021 ;  Peersman ,  2022 ). While some commodity price movements are driven by idiosyncratic shocks to supply and demand, 1 1 other commodity price movements are driven by aggregate factors, such as aggregate demand and monetary For example, the price of lithium spiked in early 2021 when US President Biden announced a plan to conditions. The role of aggregate factors in driving commodity prices is well recognized build 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles. In the same period, the price of rubber fell as a shortage in the literature.  Alquist et al.  ( 2020 ) show that up to 80% of the variance of commodity in microchip supply for vehicle makers drove forecasts for a reduction in tire demand. prices is explained by common factors (see also  Byrne et al. ,  2013 ). However, the precise channels of transmission are less well identified. 

In this paper, we contribute to the debate on the role of aggregate factors in commodity prices through a focus on interest rate shocks and various important channels. Empirical analysis of this question confront profound challenges, because of endogeneity and the general equilibrium nature of some of the mechanisms: interest rate movements are determined by several macroeconomic variables that also affect commodity markets, 2 2 One of these confounding factors is the output. For example, a low aggregate output (recession) might and cause both falling commodity prices and a reduction in interest rates by the monetary authority. Even if conversely, pure monetary shocks affect commodity markets through various channels (e.g., speculation, aggregate demand, and supply reaction) that may not be disentangled we fully control for changes in output and demand, rising commodity prices might themselves trigger a empirically. 3 tightening of monetary policy, without any change in output (see, e.g.,  Cody and Mills ,  1991 ). 3 A structural model is required to isolate the direct effect of interest rates on For example, a decline in the US interest rate can stimulate both global demand (see, e.g., commodity prices through each of these channels.  Ramey ,  2016 ) 

The obvious candidate to provide the required structure is the rational expectations comand firmsâ€™ incentive to hold inventories (see, e.g.,  Frankel ,  1986 ,  2008 ,  2014 petitive storage model, which has been developed, among others, by ), which then increase commodity  Samuelson  ( 1971 ), Newbery and Stiglitz prices. An increase in interest rates works in the opposite direction.  ( 1982 ),  Wright and Williams  ( 1982 ),  Scheinkman and Schechtman ( 1983 ),  Deaton and Laroque  ( 1992 ,  1996 ), and  Chambers and Bailey  ( 1996 ). 4 4 Samuelson  ( 1971 ) proved that the equilibrium quantities produced by this model are welfare maximizIn this model, ing for a representative consumer with marginal utility equal to the inverse demand function. commodities are assets that also have intrinsic value, separate from future cash flows. The  Deaton and Laroque  ( 1996 ) and  Cafiero et al.  ( 2011 ) showed that the model can replicate several important features of the data.
