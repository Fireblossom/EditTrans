We omit the formal proofs for the claim, as such proofs would follow very closely the ones reported in the appendix. Instead, we provide the intuition for the one-technology case (the multiple-technology case follows the same intuition). Let the alternative assumptions of claim 1 hold, and consider a disagreeing team. Note that the player with view \(\mathcal{H}\) will be hurt from a change in mind of the \(\mathcal{L}\)-view player, due to the negative production externalities of point (i). This force pushes the optimistic player to reduce information arrival in the first period, in order to decrease the (subjective) probability of a co-worker’s change in mind. However, when the relation between effort and informativeness is inverse – as of point (ii) – the way to reduce information arrival is by working harder. Hence, even under these alternative assumptions, disagreement pushes optimists to work harder and, if negative externalities are strong enough, a disagreeing team will produce on average more than any like-minded team. 35 35 A few details of the propositions will indeed need to be intuitively modified for the result to hold under the assumptions of claim 1. In particular, the second part of proposition 3 (ii) holds for \(\Delta\)_negative_  enough; and the requirement for inequalities to be strict becomes that \(\varphi^{m^{-i}}_{m^{i}}(\mathbf{e},\mathbf{k}|m^{i})\)is strictly Regardless of this equivalence, we believe that our original specification – with _ decreasing_

We conclude the discussion with a word on the welfare implications of disagreement. A welfare analysis would be particularly complex in our setup, which does not impose strong assumptions on the true process \(Q\). Without such assumptions, it is hard to tell, for instance, whether the effort levels that maximize team members’ joint expected payoffs (or are Pareto efficient in terms of expected utility) are above or below \(e^{\mathcal{H}}\)and \(e^{\mathcal{L}}\). What we can say with certainty is that if the assumptions of proposition 5 part (i) hold and if, additionally, \(Q_{x}=Q_{y}=\mathcal{H}\), any Pareto efficient stage effort must be above \(e^{\mathcal{H}}\). Hence the boost in both players’ effort generated by horizontal disagreement can – as in the example presented in section 1.1 – lead to a Pareto improvement. Not much can be concluded, however, in general. 

This final observation leaves us with a word of caution: we have shown that disagreement can increase effort. We can expect this to boost innovation and output. Increasing innovation
