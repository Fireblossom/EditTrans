tive effect for women (columns (1) to (4)), suggesting a reduced probability of encountering gender discrimination. 

The empirical findings presented in Tables  III  to  V  provide support for the following narrative: exposure to high school courses on the 1991 Colombian Constitution is associated with a more favorable attitude towards gender equality, particularly among men. Furthermore, it leads to a diminished perception of sex discrimination, particularly among women. These findings suggest that the hypothesized change in social norms primarily involves altering men’s attitudes towards gender equality. This shift in stance may have contributed to women perceiving reduced instances of sex discrimination and experiencing increased participation in the labor market (as indicated in Tables  I  and  II ). This hypothesis, while broadly formulated, aligns with specific aspects of Colombian culture, notably the prevailing male-dominated labor market where women are often relegated to the domestic sphere ( Iregui-Boh´orquez _ et al._ ,  2020 ). Furthermore, this hypothesis is in line with the idea put forth by ** ?** 

’s that promoting women’s rights requires men to have incentives to share power with women. 

### Work and Home Spheres 

In the preceding subsection, we briefly discussed the role of men in facilitating the transformation of social norms that affected women’s participation in the labor market. However, we need to provide more clarity on this matter. In this subsection, we will delve deeper into this topic by addressing the following questions: Which women are the beneficiaries of men’s most favorable views on gender equality? Are these views limited to women residing within the households of these men (e.g., their wives or daughters)? Or do they extend to women beyond their immediate households? Although the analysis in this subsection is exploratory in nature and the results are presented at a broader level, they provide valuable insights into the specific mechanisms underlying our main findings. 

In Table  VI , we examine whether women’s increased labor market participation, resulting from exposure to high school courses on the 1991 Colombian Constitution, can be attributed to their male partners’ more favorable attitude towards gender equality. 12 12 It is important to note that the attitude of an individual’s partner towards gender equality can be influenced by the treatment, making this variable a “bad control.” Therefore, the interpretation of these results should be exercised with caution. The estimates reveal no statistically significant difference between women who have partners supportive of gender equality (columns (1) to (4)) and those without such partners (columns (5) to (8)). This suggests that women’s increased participation in the labor market is unlikely due to greater support or fewer barriers imposed by their male partners. 13 13 The estimates presented in Table  A1  in Appendix  A.1  further support these findings, indicating that exposure to high school courses on the 1991 Colombian Constitution increase men’s awareness of gender equality regardless of their role as household heads.
