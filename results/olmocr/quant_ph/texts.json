Thus, the total unitary $U$ can be expressed as a direct sum of unitary operators $U = U_2 \\\\oplus U_{d-2}$. $U_{d-2}$ turns out to be irrelevant for the distance, and $U_2$ is a two-dimensional unitary that is easily parameterized. Analytical optimization in Theorem 2 yields $\\\\arccos(|\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\phi\\\\rangle|)$.\\n\\nProof. (Theorem 3 ) The dimensions except for the two dimensions of a plane where states live, can not contribute to evolution by the optimal time-independent driving Hamiltonian. Terms of these additional dimensions in $U$ just make $\\\\|i\\\\ln(U)\\\\|$ increase without changing the state, thus, they will be irrelevant for the optimal charging unitary. Generally, unitary operator $|\\\\varphi_1\\\\rangle$ lives in the plane defined by both $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle$ and $|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle$. Using the Gram-Schmidt process, we derive the orthogonal vector to $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle$ in this plane as\\n\\n$$|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle - (\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle |\\\\psi\\\\rangle)}{\\\\sqrt{1 - |\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle|^2}},$$\\n\\n(C1)\\n\\nexcept for the case $|\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle| = 1$, which is trivial since $D(|\\\\psi\\\\rangle, |\\\\varphi\\\\rangle)$ is clearly zero. $e^{-i\\\\phi}$ is a phase that can be chosen arbitrarily, but note that it appears in the parametrization below. $U$ that connects the two pure states can be expressed as a sum of three terms, $U = |\\\\varphi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi|e^{i\\\\phi_1} + |\\\\varphi_1\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi_1|e^{i\\\\phi_2} + U'$, (C2)\\n\\nwhere $U'$ is an arbitrary unitary operator that lives in the irrelevant dimensions orthogonal to $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle$ and $|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle$. $U$ can be expressed as a direct sum, $U = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\cos(\\\\theta)e^{i(\\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi)} & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta)e^{i(\\\\phi_2 + \\\\phi')} \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta)e^{i(\\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi)} & \\\\cos(\\\\theta)e^{i(\\\\phi_2 + \\\\phi')} \\\\end{array}\\\\right) \\\\oplus U'$, (C3)\\n\\nin the basis $\\\\{|\\\\psi\\\\rangle, |\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle\\\\}$. We expressed the other states as $|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle = (\\\\cos(\\\\theta)e^{i\\\\phi}, \\\\sin(\\\\theta)e^{i\\\\phi'})^T$ and $|\\\\varphi_1\\\\rangle = (-\\\\sin(\\\\theta)e^{i\\\\phi}, \\\\cos(\\\\theta)e^{i\\\\phi'})^T$ in that basis, and we assume $\\\\theta \\\\in [0, \\\\pi/2]$, $\\\\phi, \\\\phi' \\\\in [0, 2\\\\pi]$. Note that in this parametrization, $\\\\theta = \\\\arccos(|\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle|)$, $e^{i\\\\phi} = \\\\frac{|\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphi|}{|\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle|}$, $e^{i\\\\phi'} = \\\\frac{|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphi_1|}{|\\\\langle\\\\psi_1|\\\\varphi_1\\\\rangle|}$, (C4)\\n\\nas long as the denominator is nonzero. This excludes orthogonal states. If the denominator is zero, then $e^{i\\\\phi} = -\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\varphi_1\\\\rangle$, $e^{i\\\\phi'} = \\\\langle\\\\psi_1|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle$. (C5)\\n\\n$\\\\|i\\\\ln(U)\\\\|$ is function of $\\\\phi_1$ and $\\\\phi_2$ for a given $\\\\theta$, $\\\\phi$ and $\\\\phi'$ as\\n\\n$$\\\\|i\\\\ln(U)\\\\| = \\\\max \\\\left\\\\{ \\\\|i\\\\ln(U')\\\\|, \\\\right.$$ \\n\\n$$\\\\arccos \\\\left( \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi - \\\\phi_2 - \\\\phi'}{2} \\\\right) \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi + \\\\phi_2 + \\\\phi'}{2},$$\\n\\n$$\\\\arccos \\\\left( \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi - \\\\phi_2 - \\\\phi'}{2} \\\\right) \\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi + \\\\phi_2 + \\\\phi'}{2} \\\\right\\\\}$$\\n\\n(C6)\\n\\nwhich is minimized to $\\\\theta$ when $\\\\phi_1 = -\\\\phi$ and $\\\\phi_2 = -\\\\phi'$ and when $\\\\|i\\\\ln(U')\\\\|$ is smaller than the other two terms. By Theorem 2, $D(|\\\\psi\\\\rangle, |\\\\varphi\\\\rangle)$ is equal to $\\\\theta = \\\\arccos(|\\\\langle\\\\psi|\\\\varphi\\\\rangle|)$.\\n\\nThe prescription for $U_{\\\\text{opt}}$ is obtained by inserting $\\\\phi_1 = -\\\\phi$ and $\\\\phi_2 = -\\\\phi'$ into equations (C4), while considering Eq. (C2). We can also choose $U' = I_{d-2}$ as an identity on the orthogonal dimensions, since for such $U'$, $\\\\|i\\\\ln(U')\\\\| = 0$. The optimal Hamiltonian is then obtained as $V_{\\\\text{opt}} = i\\\\ln(U_{\\\\text{opt}})/D(\\\\hat{\\\\rho}, \\\\hat{\\\\sigma})$, as per Theorem 2.\\n\\nAppendix D: Proof of Theorem 4\\n\\nHere we prove an alternate formula for the charging distance for mixed states. Sketch. We will show that condition $U\\\\hat{\\\\rho}U^\\\\dagger = \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}$ implies the form $U = \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^m U_i (\\\\sum_{k=1}^n |s_i^k\\\\rangle \\\\langle r_i^k|)$. (D1)\\n\\nProof. (Theorem 4) Any unitary operator can be written as a product of two unitary operators, $U = U'U''$. (D2)\\n\\n$U''$ can be chosen arbitrarily and $U'$ is determined by $U$ and $U''$. We set $U'' = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{k=1}^n |s_i^k\\\\rangle \\\\langle r_i^k|$. Then\\n\\n$$U = U' \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{k=1}^n |s_i^k\\\\rangle \\\\langle r_i^k|.$$ (D3)\\n\\n$U$ has to satisfy\\n\\n$$U\\\\hat{\\\\rho}U^\\\\dagger = U'\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}U'^\\\\dagger = \\\\hat{\\\\sigma},$$ (D4)\\n\\nwhich can be rewritten as\\n\\n$$[U', \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}] = 0.$$ (D5)\\n\\nWe use a general representation of a matrix to express $U'$ as\\n\\n$$U' = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n u_{ikjl} |s_i^k\\\\rangle \\\\langle s_j^l|.$$ (D6)\\n\\nWe compute the commutator,\\n\\n$$[U', \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n (r_j - r_i) u_{ikjl} |s_i^k\\\\rangle \\\\langle s_j^l|.$$ (D7)\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"which manages to obtain results (albeit not necessarily outstanding ones) up until instance 412, with 300 requests.\\n\\nFurthermore, 2000Q cannot handle instances larger than 503 (143 requests), where the limit of Advantage2 is at instance 404 (100 requests).

While MCMC can reach lattice sizes of order of $10^3 \\\\times 200$, which are currently unthinkable for QC and TN techniques, the Hamiltonian formulation used for the latter methods has several advantages. For example, MCMC suffers from very large autocorrelation times towards the continuum limit [88]. In the regime of small to very small lattice spacing, we can take advantage of quantum computing or tensor network approaches that do not have this drawback. Furthermore, the Euclidean path integral used by MCMC is afflicted by the infamous sign problem [5] which makes the study of quantum field theories at non-zero fermion densities impossible. More specifically for lattice QCD, this prevents the exploration and characterization of regions of the phase diagram at non-zero baryon density, which are relevant to understand the early universe, neutron stars, or the transition to a quark-gluon plasma. Another important aspect is the limitation for classical MCMC techniques in the presence of a topological term which, in stark contrast, can be treated straightforwardly in the Hamiltonian formulation, i.e. with QC or TN. Finally, a Hamiltonian approach will enable the study of real-time phenomena such as scattering processes, thermalization or the dynamics of physical systems after quenching, see the discussion in Sec. I and below.\\n\\nAlthough we are fully aware of the advancements of TN [10], in the spirit of this paper, we will focus on the quantum computing approach to study quantum field theories and, in particular, on the example of (2+1)D QED.\\n\\nAnother pillar of quantum information science and technology is analog quantum simulators [37, 89, 90] which allow direct experimental access to various quantum many-body phenomena. Given recent advancements in quantum-simulator technology such as single-atom resolution through gas microscopes [91\u201393] and overall high levels of precision and control [94], quantum simulators have become an attractive venue on which to probe high-energy phenomena [9, 41, 95\u201397], affording the precious advantage of accessible temporal snapshots at any stage of the system dynamics. The modus operandi of quantum simulators is to map a target model described by a Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_0$ onto another quantum model amenable for realization in an experimental platform. This mapping is almost never exact but will lead to an effective model where $\\\\hat{H}_0$ arises up to leading order in perturbation theory, along with (undesired) subleading terms $\\\\lambda \\\\hat{H}_1$, with strength $\\\\lambda < 1$. In the context of gauge theories, the model $\\\\hat{H}_0$ hosts a gauge symmetry generated by local operators $G_j$, while $\\\\hat{H}_1$ explicitly breaks it.\\n\\nInitially, quantum simulators of gauge theories were restricted to cold-atom realizations of building blocks for both $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ [98] and U(1) gauge groups [99]. The experiment of Ref. [98] employed two species of bosonic cold atoms in a double-well potential. Periodic driving resonant on the on-site interaction strength and with the appropriate fine-tuning of the modulation parameters resulted in an effective Floquet Hamiltonian with the desired $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge symmetry. On the other hand, the experiment of Ref. [99] employed inter-species spin-changing collisions to model the gauge-invariant coupling between matter and gauge fields. Although groundbreaking in their own right, these experiments were restricted to building blocks and suffered from uncontrolled subleading gauge-noninvariant processes that limited useful coherent times [100].\\n\\nTo probe gauge-theory physics relevant to high-energy phenomena, it became essential to devise experimentally feasible methods that could enable large-scale implementations on quantum simulators.

In the regime of small to very small lattice spacing, we can take advantage of quantum computing or tensor network approaches that do not have this drawback. Furthermore, the Euclidean path integral used by MCMC is afflicted by the infamous sign problem [ 5 ] which makes the study of quantum field theories at non-zero fermion densities impossible. More specifically for lattice QCD, this prevents the exploration and characterization of regions of the phase diagram at non-zero baryon density, which are relevant to understand the early universe, neutron stars, or the transition to a quark-gluon plasma. Another important aspect is the limitation for classical MCMC techniques in the presence of a topological term which, in stark contrast, can be treated straightforwardly in the Hamiltonian formulation, i.e. with QC or TN. Finally, a Hamiltonian approach will enable the study of real-time phenomena such as scattering processes, thermalization or the dynamics of physical systems after quenching, see the discussion in Sec. I and below. Although we are fully aware of the advancements of TN [ 10 ], in the spirit of this paper, we will focus on the quantum computing approach to study quantum field theories and, in particular, on the example of (2+1)D QED. Another pillar of quantum information science and technology is analog quantum simulators [ 37 , 89 , 90 ] which allow direct experimental access to various quantum many-body phenomena. Given recent advancements in quantum-simulator technology such as single-atom resolution through gas microscopes [ 91 \u2013 93 ] and overall high levels of precision and control [ 94 ], quantum simulators have become an attractive venue on which to probe high-energy phenomena [ 9 , 41 , 95 \u2013 97 ], affording the precious advantage of accessible temporal snapshots at any stage of the system dynamics. The modus operandi of quantum simulators is to map a target model described by a Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_0$ onto another quantum model amenable for realization in an experimental platform. This mapping is almost never exact but will lead to an effective model where $\\\\hat{H}_0$ arises up to leading order in perturbation theory, along with (undesired) subleading terms $\\\\lambda \\\\hat{H}_1$, with strength $\\\\lambda < 1$. In the context of gauge theories, the model $\\\\hat{H}_0$ hosts a gauge symmetry generated by local operators $G_j$, while $\\\\hat{H}_1$ explicitly breaks it. Initially, quantum simulators of gauge theories were restricted to cold-atom realizations of building blocks for both $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ [ 98 ] and U(1) gauge groups [ 99 ]. The experiment of Ref. [ 98 ] employed two species of bosonic cold atoms in a double-well potential. Periodic driving resonant on the on-site interaction strength and with the appropriate fine-tuning of the modulation parameters resulted in an effective Floquet Hamiltonian with the desired $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge symmetry. On the other hand, the experiment of Ref. [ 99 ] employed inter-species spin-changing collisions to model the gauge-invariant coupling between matter and gauge fields. Although groundbreaking in their own right, these experiments were restricted to building blocks and suffered from uncontrolled subleading gauge-noninvariant processes that limited useful coherent times [ 100 ]. To probe gauge-theory physics relevant to high-energy phenomena, it became essential to devise experimentally feasible methods that could enable large-scale implementations on quantum simulators.

[16] proposes a greedy algorithm to generate a path for entanglement swapping and maximize the number of satisfied demands concerning start and end times along with the number of entangled pairs. A mechanism to find the shortest path for entanglement distribution with nested purification of qubits has been proposed in [41]. Authors present a real-time and pre-established entanglement distribution in [17], [42] describes a hybrid continuous variable-discrete variable (CV-DV) quantum network which can distribute a large number of entanglements for multi-hop nodes. [18] proposes a proactive entanglement distribution using the history of actual qubits used along each physical link. The history is an indirect measure of user demands.\\n\\nFrom the above survey, it is evident that there is a huge effort in ensuring quick and efficient entanglement distribution. Some of the works have also focussed on meeting user demand for entanglement generation. Most of the proposals are based on a bottom-up approach to meet user demands. The main motivation of this work is to understand how usage patterns can impact entanglement distribution in terms of edge and node centralities. As observed from the above survey, such an effort to understand the network centralities of entanglement distribution has not been attempted. This work is thus relevant as the quantum internet grows in size and its characteristics emerge to its classical counterpart.\\n\\nIII. System Model\\n\\nFirstly, the basics of quantum communications are discussed and then the model is explained.\\n\\nA. Quantum Basics\\n\\n1) Quantum States: Quantum bits (qubits) are in a superposition of their orthonormal basis states. A single qubit can be represented as $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha|0\\\\rangle + \\\\beta|1\\\\rangle$ where $|\\\\alpha|^2 + |\\\\beta|^2 = 1$, $|0\\\\rangle$ and $|1\\\\rangle$ are the orthonormal basis states. Similarly, a two-qubit can be represented as $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\gamma_1|00\\\\rangle + \\\\gamma_2|01\\\\rangle + \\\\gamma_3|11\\\\rangle + \\\\gamma_4|10\\\\rangle$ where $|\\\\gamma_1|^2 + |\\\\gamma_2|^2 + |\\\\gamma_3|^2 + |\\\\gamma_4|^2 = 1$, $|00\\\\rangle$, $|01\\\\rangle$, $|11\\\\rangle$ and $|10\\\\rangle$ are the orthonormal basis states. Measurement of a qubit leads to the collapse of the qubit to one of its basis states. For example, $\\\\psi$ when measured will collapse to one of its four orthonormal states with probability $|\\\\gamma_x|^2$, where $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$.\\n\\n2) Quantum Entanglement: A two-qubit system can be in a special state which cannot be expressed as a tensor product of two other states. Let consider a qubit $|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle = \\\\delta_1|01\\\\rangle + \\\\delta_2|11\\\\rangle$. This can be represented as $|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle = (\\\\delta_1|0\\\\rangle + \\\\delta_2|1\\\\rangle) \\\\otimes |1\\\\rangle$ where $\\\\otimes$ is the tensor product. However, a special two-qubit of the form $|\\\\psi_2\\\\rangle = \\\\delta_1|00\\\\rangle + \\\\delta_2|11\\\\rangle$ cannot be represented as a tensor product to two states as $|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle$. These special states are called entangled states. There are four maximally entangled states also known as Bell pairs or EPR pairs, namely, $\\\\frac{|00\\\\rangle + |11\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$, $\\\\frac{|01\\\\rangle + |10\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$, and $\\\\frac{|01\\\\rangle - |10\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$. If the first qubit of the EPR pair is given to one node and the other to the second, and a measurement is performed on the EPR pair then their states are highly deterministic. For example, $\\\\frac{|01\\\\rangle + |10\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$ will collapse with the first node having a value 0 and the other having a value 1, and vice versa when measured.\\n\\n3) Quantum Entanglement Swapping: If a node A is entangled to B and B in turn is entangled to C then A and C can be entangled with the measurement of the two individual entanglements. This is known as Quantum Entanglement Swapping. This process can be repeated over multiple hops to create a long-distance entanglement.\\n\\n4) Quantum Teleportation: In a nutshell, quantum teleportation is a method of transferring any arbitrary qubit $\\\\Psi$ from one source to another using a Bell pair shared between them. It requires a classical channel to communicate the results of the measurement to the receiver. Using the result, the receiver applies linear transforms to recreate $\\\\Psi$.\\n\\nB. Model Description\\n\\nLet there be $N$ nodes in a quantum network. There are $E$ edges in the network indexed with $i$. A node $j$ can have uniform random number of edges $X_j^{(p)}$ in the range 1 to $[\\\\alpha N]$, $0 < \\\\alpha \\\\leq 1$, with other nodes.

Thus, the total number of edges that connect node $j$ to its entangled neighbours (physical and virtual) is denoted by $X_j$.

Traditionally, edge centrality measures are based on the shortest paths between nodes.

[16] proposes a greedy algorithm to generate a path for entanglement swapping and maximize the number of satisfied demands concerning start and end times along with the number of entangled pairs. A mechanism to find the shortest path for entanglement distribution with nested purification of qubits has been proposed in [41]. Authors present a real-time and preestablished entanglement distribution in [17]. [42] describes a hybrid continuous variable-discrete variable (CV-DV) quantum network which can distribute a large number of entanglements for multi-hop nodes. [18] proposes a proactive entanglement distribution using the history of actual qubits used along each physical link. The history is an indirect measure of user demands. From the above survey, it is evident that there is a huge effort in ensuring quick and efficient entanglement distribution. Some of the works have also focussed on meeting user demand for entanglement generation. Most of the proposals are based on a bottom-up approach to meet user demands. The main motivation of this work is to understand how usage patterns can impact entanglement distribution in terms of edge and node centralities. As observed from the above survey, such an effort to understand the network centralities of entanglement distribution has not been attempted. This work is thus relevant as the quantum internet grows in size and its characteristics emerge to its classical counterpart. \\n\\nIII. System Model\\n\\nFirstly, the basics of quantum communications are discussed and then the model is explained. \\n\\nA. Quantum Basics\\n\\n1) Quantum States: Quantum bits (qubits) are in a superposition of their orthonormal basis states. A single qubit can be represented as $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha|0\\\\rangle + \\\\beta|1\\\\rangle$ where $|\\\\alpha|^2 + |\\\\beta|^2 = 1$, $|0\\\\rangle$ and $|1\\\\rangle$ are the orthonormal basis states. Similarly, a two-qubit can be represented as $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\gamma_1|00\\\\rangle + \\\\gamma_2|01\\\\rangle + \\\\gamma_3|11\\\\rangle + \\\\gamma_4|10\\\\rangle$ where $|\\\\gamma_1|^2 + |\\\\gamma_2|^2 + |\\\\gamma_3|^2 + |\\\\gamma_4|^2 = 1$, $|00\\\\rangle$, $|01\\\\rangle$, $|11\\\\rangle$ and $|10\\\\rangle$ are the orthonormal basis states. Measurement of a qubit leads to the collapse of the qubit to one of its basis states. For example, $\\\\psi$ when measured will collapse to one of its four orthonormal states with probability $|\\\\gamma_x|^2$, where $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$.\\n\\n2) Quantum Entanglement: A two-qubit system can be in a special state which cannot be expressed as a tensor product of two other states. Lets consider a qubit $|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle = \\\\delta_1|01\\\\rangle + \\\\delta_2|11\\\\rangle$. This can be represented as $|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle = (\\\\delta_1|0\\\\rangle + \\\\delta_2|1\\\\rangle) \\\\otimes |1\\\\rangle$ where $\\\\otimes$ is the tensor product. However, a special two-qubit of the form $|\\\\psi_2\\\\rangle = \\\\delta_1|00\\\\rangle + \\\\delta_2|11\\\\rangle$ cannot be represented as a tensor product to two states as $|\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle$. These special states are called entangled states. There are four maximally entangled states also known as Bell pairs or EPR pairs, namely, $\\\\frac{|00\\\\rangle + |11\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$, $\\\\frac{|01\\\\rangle + |10\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\\\frac{|01\\\\rangle - |10\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$. If the first qubit of the EPR pair is given to one node and the other to the second, and a measurement is performed on the EPR pair then their states are highly deterministic. For example, $\\\\frac{|01\\\\rangle + |10\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$ will collapse with the first node having a value 1 and the other having a value 0, and vice versa when measured. Quantum Entanglement Swapping : If a node A is entangled to B and B in turn is entangled to C then A and C can be entangled with the measurement of the two individual entanglements. This is known as Quantum Entanglement Swapping. This process can be repeated over multiple hops to create a long-distance entanglement.\\n\\n4) Quantum Teleportation: In a nutshell, quantum teleportation is a method of transferring any arbitrary qubit $\\\\Psi$ from one source to another using a Bell pair shared between them. It requires a classical channel to communicate the results of the measurement to the receiver. Using the result, the receiver applies linear transforms to recreate $\\\\Psi$.\\n\\nB. Model Description\\n\\nLet there be $N$ nodes in a quantum network. There are $E$ edges in the network indexed with $i$. A node $j$ can have uniform random number of edges $X_j^{(p)}$ in the range 1 to $[\\\\alpha N]$, $0 < \\\\alpha \\\\leq 1$, with other nodes. These $X_j^{(p)}$ are designated as physical edges which can be used to set up direct entanglements between the connected nodes. These entangled physical edges can help in setting up entanglement between nodes that are not physically connected using quantum entanglement swapping. For example, if node A is entangled with B and B in turn is entangled with C then applying entanglement swapping A and C can get entangled. Such edges which connect two remote entangled nodes set up using entanglement swapping are designated as virtual edges $X_j^{(v)}$. Thus, the total number of edges that connect node $j$ to its entangled neighbours (physical and virtual) is denoted by $X_j$. Thus,\\n\\n$$X_j = X_j^{(p)} + X_j^{(v)}$$\\n\\nThis process of entanglement generation either directly through a physical link or indirectly through entanglement swapping can provide valuable insights (e.g., the centrality of edges) on how each physical edge $e_i^{(p)}$ or a virtual $e_i^{(v)}$ edge is involved in entanglement generation for a large quantum network when entanglements are needed between two remote nodes based on user connection setup requests $k$. Traditionally, edge centrality measures are based on the shortest paths between nodes. Since, quantum entanglements are used on a peer-to-peer basis (when measurements are performed) usage frequencies ($f_{e_i^{(p)}}$ or $f_{e_i^{(v)}}$) of links during the entanglement generation and distributions are used as a measure of edge centrality in this paper. Generally, $f_{e_i}$ denotes the usage frequency of any edge either physical or virtual in an entanglement setup. The higher the usage of a link the larger is its edge centrality.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, an edge (physical or virtual) is created in the graph of the quantum network when the two nodes share an entanglement.

This limitation already causes problems if a single field mode is considered as the system. Even though this can be circumvented by appropriate truncation of the Hilbert space if the dynamics are restricted to a finite subspace, it remains a minor short-coming of an otherwise very convincing approach.\\n\\nIII. APPLICATION TO EXAMPLES\\n\\nTo compare these different approaches we study the implications for a simple model and three types of interaction. A two-level system (TLS) or atom is considered as the system of interest and a mode of the radiation field as its environment.\\n\\nThis is a standard example in quantum optics and it has been considered in various variations in quantum thermodynamics. It is also frequently encountered as an analogue to a steam engine with a working medium (gas, TLS) coupled to a work depository (piston, field mode) [16, 31]. One advantage of this system, and probably the reason for its frequent use as a model, is that it can be treated analytically. Further, semi-classical analogues are available, that can be exploited for a comparison with semi-classical results.\\n\\nThe free Hamiltonian is $H_0 = H_S + H_E$ with $H_S = \\\\omega_S \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger \\\\sigma$ and $H_E = \\\\sigma + \\\\omega_E a^\\\\dagger a$ where $\\\\omega_S$ and $\\\\omega_E$ denote the frequencies and $\\\\sigma$ and $a$ the lowering operators of atom and field, respectively.\\n\\nAtom and field are initially uncorrelated, i.e. they are in a product state $\\\\rho(0) = \\\\rho_S(0) \\\\otimes \\\\rho_E(0)$ with\\n\\n$$\\\\rho_S(0) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} p_e & p_{eg} \\\\\\\\ p_{eg} & p_g \\\\end{pmatrix}$$\\n\\n(31)\\n\\nand the field is in a thermal state, i.e. $\\\\rho_E(0) = (1 - e^{-\\\\beta H_E}) e^{-\\\\beta H_E}$ where $\\\\beta = 1/k_B T$.\\n\\nFor the minimal dissipation approach we have to determine the master equation for the reduced density matrix and identify the effective Hamiltonian and traceless Lindblad operators with corresponding rates. The procedure for this setup is detailed in Appendix A.\\n\\nA. Jaynes-Cummings\\n\\nAt first we consider the interaction Hamiltonian given by the Jaynes-Cummings model:\\n\\n$$H_{SE} = g(\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger + \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$$\\n\\n(32)\\n\\nwith interaction parameter $g$. $H_{SE}$ does not commute with the free Hamiltonians of atom and field: $[H_{SE}, H_S] = g \\\\omega_S (\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger - \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$ and $[H_{SE}, H_E] = -g \\\\omega_E (\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger - \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$.\\n\\nWe obtain the correction Hamiltonian $H_S^c = g(\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger + \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$ which does not commute with $H_S$ (see Eqs. (6) and (8)). Consequently, the effective atomic Hamiltonian equals the bare Hamiltonian in $\\\\Lambda$: $H_S^c = H_S$. In this way $U_S$ corresponds to the conventional identification, Eq. (1). The work and heat fluxes are given by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12). Only on resonance we obtain zero net work flux $\\\\dot{W}_S + \\\\dot{W}_E = 0$ and heat flux $\\\\dot{Q}_S + \\\\dot{Q}_E = 0$, because then $[H_{SE}, H_S + H_E] = 0$.\\n\\nIn B the correction $H_S^c$ contributes to the effective local Hamiltonian, provided correlations are built up. In the explored parameter range this results only in a small deviation for the integrated fluxes compared to LEMBAS (compare the lines labeled A and B in Fig. 1, where $\\\\alpha_S = 0$). For large interaction strengths $g$ and considerable coherence in both, atom and field state, the difference between the quantities increases, because it arises due to $H_{SE}$ and the development of correlations.\\n\\nThe identification of work and heat in the decomposition scheme (lines labeled C in Fig. 1) is qualitatively\"}\n\n "], "olmocr": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"the requirement of Hermiticity and trace preservation follows that the generator can be rewritten as $\\\\mathcal{L}_t = \\\\mathcal{H}_t + \\\\mathcal{D}_t$ with a Hamiltonian part $\\\\mathcal{H}_t[.] = -i[H_S(t), .]$ and a dissipator with generalized Lindblad structure\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{D}_t[.] = \\\\sum_k \\\\gamma_k \\\\left[ L_k \\\\cdot L_k^\\\\dagger - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\{ L_k^\\\\dagger L_k, . \\\\} \\\\right]$$\\n\\n(24)\\n\\nwith time dependent rate functions $\\\\{ \\\\gamma_k(t) \\\\}$ and operators $L_k(t)$.

The change of internal energy, work and heat is now given by\\n\\n$$\\\\Delta U_S(t) = \\\\text{Tr}(H_S^D(t) \\\\rho_S(t)) - \\\\text{Tr}(H_S^D(0) \\\\rho_S(0))$$\\n\\n(27)\\n\\n$$\\\\delta W_S(t) = D_{\\\\text{int}}(0) \\\\text{d}t' \\\\text{Tr}(H_S^D(t') \\\\rho_S(t'))$$\\n\\n(28)\\n\\n$$\\\\delta Q_S(t) = D_{\\\\text{int}}(0) \\\\text{d}t' \\\\text{Tr}(H_S^D(t') \\\\mathcal{D}_t[\\\\rho_S])$$\\n\\n(29)\\n\\n(30)\\n\\nThe advantage of this identification is that it just depends on the system state $\\\\rho_S$ and could, in general, be applied without knowledge about the environment. In addition, it is based on an extremum principle. However, the useful correspondence between minimal dissipator and traceless Lindblad operators is only established for finite Hilbert spaces. This limitation already causes problems if a single field mode is considered as the system. Even though this can be circumvented by appropriate truncation of the Hilbert space if the dynamics are restricted to a finite subspace, it remains a minor short-coming of an otherwise very convincing approach.  \\n\\nIII. APPLICATION TO EXAMPLES\\n\\nTo compare these different approaches we study the implications for a simple model and three types of interaction. A two-level system (TLS) or atom is considered as the system of interest and a mode of the radiation field as its environment. This is a standard example in quantum optics and it has been considered in various variations in quantum thermodynamics. It is also frequently encountered as an analogue to a steam engine with a working medium (gas, TLS) coupled to a work depository (piston, field mode) [16, 31]. One advantage of this system, and probably the reason for its frequent use as a model, is that it can be treated analytically. Further, semi-classical analogues are available, that can be exploited for a comparison with semi-classical results.\\n\\nThe free Hamiltonian is $H_0 = H_S + H_E$ with $H_S = \\\\omega_S \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger \\\\sigma$ and $H_E = \\\\sigma + \\\\omega_E a^\\\\dagger a$ where $\\\\omega_S$ and $\\\\omega_E$ denote the frequencies and $\\\\sigma$ and $a$ the lowering operators of atom and field, respectively. Atom and field are initially uncorrelated, i.e. they are in a product state $\\\\rho(0) = \\\\rho_S(0) \\\\otimes \\\\rho_E(0)$ with\\n\\n$$\\\\rho_S(0) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} p_e & p_{eg} \\\\\\\\ p_{eg} & p_g \\\\end{pmatrix}$$\\n\\n(31)\\n\\nand the field is in a thermal state, i.e. $\\\\rho_E(0) = (1 - e^{-\\\\beta H_E}) e^{-\\\\beta H_E}$ where $\\\\beta = 1/k_B T$.\\n\\nFor the minimal dissipation approach we have to determine the master equation for the reduced density matrix and identify the effective Hamiltonian and traceless Lindblad operators with corresponding rates. The procedure for this setup is detailed in Appendix A.  \\n\\nA. Jaynes-Cummings\\n\\nAt first we consider the interaction Hamiltonian given by the Jaynes-Cummings model:\\n\\n$$H_{SE} = g(\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger + \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$$\\n\\n(32)\\n\\nwith interaction parameter $g$. $H_{SE}$ does not commute with the free Hamiltonians of atom and field: $[H_{SE}, H_S] = g \\\\omega_S (\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger - \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$ and $[H_{SE}, H_E] = -g \\\\omega_E (\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger - \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$. We obtain the correction Hamiltonian $H_S^c = g(\\\\sigma a^\\\\dagger + \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger a)$ which does not commute with $H_S$ (see Eqs. (6) and (8)). Consequently, the effective atomic Hamiltonian equals the bare Hamiltonian in $\\\\Lambda$: $H_S^c = H_S$. In this way $U_S$ corresponds to the conventional identification, Eq. (1). The work and heat fluxes are given by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12). Only on resonance we obtain zero net work flux $\\\\dot{W}_S + \\\\dot{W}_E = 0$ and heat flux $\\\\dot{Q}_S + \\\\dot{Q}_E = 0$, because then $[H_{SE}, H_S + H_E] = 0$.\\n\\nIn B the correction $H_S^c$ contributes to the effective local Hamiltonian, provided correlations are built up. In the explored parameter range this results only in a small deviation for the integrated fluxes compared to LEMBAS (compare the lines labeled A and B in Fig. 1, where $\\\\alpha_S = 0$). For large interaction strengths $g$ and considerable coherence in both, atom and field state, the difference between the quantities increases, because it arises due to $H_{SE}$ and the development of correlations.\\n\\nThe identification of work and heat in the decomposition scheme (lines labeled C in Fig. 1) is qualitatively\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"tests showed that our method can compute polynomials of degree greater than $10^7$ in under a minute, an impressive computational efficiency when compared to the $10^4$ degree polynomials that can be achieved using existing QSP approaches via the state-of-the-art techniques of [14].\\n\\nIn this paper, we explored several applications of our GQSP methodology.

An alternative strategy involves computing a defined parameter $\\\\eta$ as $\\\\eta = \\\\log_{10}(\\\\langle \\\\text{IPR} \\\\rangle \\\\times \\\\langle \\\\text{NPR} \\\\rangle)$ [39]. By assessing the ratio of extended to localized states within all $N$ eigenstates, we establish the criteria for the reentrant regime.

(2). We choose $t = 0.08$ and $\\\\Delta = 0.25$, so the intra/inter-cell coupling strength is 0.1 and 0.06, which sets the lattice at the topologically trivial phase [29]. Fig. 1(b) presents the results of sweeping the on-site potential from 0 to 0.4 across the random-dimer number array. Subsequently, we conduct numerical calculations to determine the lattice\u2019s spectrum, unveiling the system\u2019s energy levels and their corresponding IPR. The spectrum of the system is given by four well distinguished bands, centered around $E_{\\\\nu, \\\\pm} = \\\\nu \\\\epsilon \\\\pm t(1 + \\\\Delta)$, with wave functions, living mostly on the dimers with the on-site potential $\\\\epsilon_n = \\\\nu \\\\epsilon$, $\\\\nu = 0, 1$, and being symmetric (antisymmetric) at each of such dimers with the corresponding energy shift $\\\\mp t(1 + \\\\Delta)$, respectively, see Supplemental Information. The width of each band is given by the smaller hopping $2t(1 - \\\\Delta)$. The blue curve uncovers the closing and reopening of the energy gap in the system, signifying the topological phase transition of the eigenstates. It is this gap closure which is responsible for the reentrant delocalization. Indeed, close to the intersection of 2 bands, the effective disorder is given by the difference of energy centers $E_{\\\\nu, \\\\pm}$. As soon as 2 bands cross, this difference goes to zero and a disorder-free sector of the Hamiltonian with delocalized states emerges at this crossing-band pair. The states in the other pair of bands stay localized. This explains the reentrant character of delocalization-localization phase diagram.\\n\\nFig. 2(a) displays the simulated pattern of the 41st single-site excitation obtained using the coupled mode theory [41\u201343] to showcase the evolution of light within lattices having a length of 1000 $\\\\mu$m. The on-site potentials $\\\\epsilon$ of these lattices are 0, 0.1, 0.185 and 0.3, from left to right. Comparing Fig. 2(a) III with II and I, we observe that the light undergoes a distinct behavior in III. In this intermediate regime III, a part of the light intensity stays near the initial location as in II, but another part ballistically spreads as in I.

( 2 ). We choose $t = 0.08$ and $\\\\Delta = 0.25$, so the intra/inter-cell coupling strength is 0.1 and 0.06, which sets the lattice at the topologically trivial phase [ 29 ]. Fig. 1 (b) presents the results of sweeping the on-site potential from 0 to 0.4 across the random-dimer number array. Subsequently, we conduct numerical calculations to determine the lattice\u2019s spectrum, unveiling the system\u2019s energy levels and their corresponding IPR. The spectrum of the system is given by four well distinguished bands, centered around $E_{\\\\nu, \\\\pm} = \\\\nu \\\\epsilon \\\\pm t(1 + \\\\Delta)$, with wave functions, living mostly on the dimers with the on-site potential $\\\\epsilon_n = \\\\nu \\\\epsilon$, $\\\\nu = 0, 1$, and being symmetric (antisymmetric) at each of such dimers with the corresponding energy shift $\\\\mp t(1 + \\\\Delta)$, respectively, see Supplemental Information. The width of each band is given by the smaller hopping $2t(1 - \\\\Delta)$. The blue curve uncovers the closing and reopening of the energy gap in the system, signifying the topological phase transition of the eigenstates. It is this gap closure which is responsible for the reentrant delocalization. Indeed, close to the intersection of 2 bands, the effective disorder is given by the difference of energy centers $E_{\\\\nu, \\\\pm}$. As soon as 2 bands cross, this difference goes to zero and a disorder-free sector of the Hamiltonian with delocalized states emerges at this crossing-band pair. The states in the other pair of bands stay localized. This explains the reentrant character of delocalization-localization phase diagram. \\n\\nFig. 2 (a) displays the simulated pattern of the 41 \u2013 43 ] to showcase the evolution of light within lattices having a length of 1000 $\\\\mu$m. The on-site potentials $\\\\epsilon$ of these lattices are 0, 0.1, 0.185 and 0.3, from left to right. Comparing Fig. 2 (a) III with II and I, we observe that the light undergoes a distinct behavior in III. In this intermediate regime III, a part of the light intensity stays near the initial location as in II, but another part ballistically spreads as in I. This gives evidence of a coexistence of localized and extended light, observed simultaneously. Unexpectedly this coexistence appears even after the light has transitioned into the fully localized regime II upon reaching the critical value of the on-site potential, $\\\\epsilon$.

This reduction is caused by a perturbative component of the hyperfine tensor in combination with the finite magnetic field strength (see Supplementary Section V D). Flipping the electron spin between $m_s = \\\\pm 1$ changes the quantization axes of the nuclear spins, which causes a change of the nuclear-nuclear interactions [? ], which is not decoupled by the spin-echo sequence (see Extended Data Fig. E4). The effect is strongest for spins near the NV center. For larger fields or for spins with weak hyperfine couplings, we expect that further resolution enhancement is possible by applying multiple refocusing pulses (see Supplementary Section V D).\\n\\nFinally, we combine spin-chain sensing and electron-nuclear double resonance to correlate high-resolution spin frequencies ($\\\\Delta_i$) with specific spin-spin couplings ($C_{ij}$), even when a chain contains multiple spins with overlapping frequencies. We illustrate this scheme on a chain of spins, where two spins (2 and 3) have a similar frequency $A_{23}$ and both couple to $A_1$ and $A_4$ (Fig. 4a). The goal is to extract $\\\\Delta_2$, $\\\\Delta_3$ and the couplings to Spin 4 ($C_{24}$, $C_{34}$). As a reference, standard double-resonance shows a quickly decaying time-domain signal, indicating couplings to multiple spins that are spectrally unresolved (Fig. 4b).\\n\\nFigure 4c shows how the electron-nuclear double resonance sequence (mint green) is inserted in the spin-chain sequence to perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the $A_{23}$ frequency region. Sweeping the interaction time $t_1$ shows multiple frequencies (Fig. 4d), hinting at the existence of multiple spins with approximately $A_{23}$.

The observed coherence time $T_2 = 0.36(2)$ s is slightly shorter than the bare nuclear spin-echo time $T_{2,SE} = 0.62(5)$ s. This reduction is caused by a perturbitive component of the hyperfine tensor in combination with the finite magnetic field strength (see Supplementary Section V D). Flipping the electron spin between $m_s = \\\\pm 1$ changes the quantization axes of the nuclear spins, which causes a change of the nuclear-nuclear interactions [? ], which is not decoupled by the spin-echo sequence (see Extended Data Fig. E4). The effect is strongest for spins near the NV center. For larger fields or for spins with weak hyperfine couplings, we expect that further resolution enhancement is possible by applying multiple refocusing pulses (see Supplementary Section V D). Finally, we combine spin-chain sensing and electronnuclear double resonance to correlate high-resolution spin frequencies (\u0394i) with specific spin-spin couplings (Cij), even when a chain contains multiple spins with overlapping frequencies. We illustrate this scheme on a chain of spins, where two spins (2 and 3) have a similar frequency $A_{23}$ and both couple to $A_1$ and $A_4$ (Fig. 4 and the couplings to Spin 4 (C24, C34). As a reference, standard double-resonance shows a quickly decaying time-domain signal, indicating couplings to multiple spins that are spectrally unresolved (Fig. 4b). Figure 4c shows how the electron-nuclear double resonance sequence (mint green) is inserted in the spinchain sequence to perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the $A_{23}$ frequency region. Sweeping the interaction time $t_1$ shows multiple frequencies (Fig. 4d), hinting at the existence of multiple spins with approximately $A_{23}$. The result is consistent with two spins at frequencies $\\\\Delta_2 = 8019.5(2)$ Hz and $\\\\Delta_3 = 7695.2(1)$ Hz, split by an internal coupling of $C_{23} = 7.6(1)$ Hz (Fig.  4a and Extended Data Fig. E2e,f). Next, we add a nuclear-nuclear block (pink) and sweep both electron-nuclear (t1) and nuclear-nuclear (t2) double-resonance times to correlate $\\\\Delta_2$ and $\\\\Delta_3$ with nuclear-nuclear couplings $C_{24}$ and $C_{34}$. The 2D power spectral density (PSD) shows signals in two distinct frequency regions along the $f_1$-axis, corresponding to $\\\\Delta_2$ and $\\\\Delta_3$. Analysing the nuclear-nuclear (f2) signal at these frequencies (Fig. 4f), we find $C_{24} = -11.8(2)$ Hz and $C_{34} = -0.2(5)$ Hz. We attribute the splitting to the coupling $C_{23}$ between Spins 2 and 3 (Methods, Extended Data Fig.  E2g,h).  Varying RF4 enables the measurement of the interactions of spins 2 and 3 to other parts of the network (for example to determine $C_{12}, C_{13}$).

Fig. 6 displays the transmission and phase change spectra under x- and y-polarised plane waves while altering the width and depth of the nanodisks. The design of nanodisks is optimized to enhance both transmission rate and phase change.

The excessive computational cost of quantum trajectories, however, hampers meaningful progress. Deterministic strategies, such as the one put forth in this letter, are therefore crucial. A famous example of a successful deterministic theory is that of current feedback put forth in Refs. [64, 65]. The significant impact it had in the field shows that even though it deals with a restrictive type of feedback, having a deterministic strategy is nonetheless extremely valuable. We believe a similar point can be made for our results.\\n\\nA particularly interesting application of our results is to the so-called gambling problems, such as that studied in [25].

While their results focus only on diffusive measurements of a single Hermitian jump operator, our framework captures both jump and diffusion cases and includes multiple jump operators which need not be Hermitian.\\n\\nIt is interesting to point out how feedback and FPT also share similar practical difficulties: using quantum trajectories one can implement arbitrary feedback strategies, as well as arbitrary FPT conditions (e.g. stopping for stochastic quantities other than $N(t)$). The excessive computational cost of quantum trajectories, however, hampers meaningful progress. Deterministic strategies, such as the one put forth in this letter, are therefore crucial. A famous example of a successful deterministic theory is that of current feedback put forth in Refs. [64, 65]. The significant impact it had in the field shows that even though it deals with a restrictive type of feedback, having a deterministic strategy is nonetheless extremely valuable. We believe a similar point can be made for our results.\\n\\nA particularly interesting application of our results is to the so-called gambling problems, such as that studied in [25]. This involves an agent which uses information about the system\u2019s state to devise stopping strategies aimed at maximizing a certain goal, which can be relevant in the context of thermodynamics. For instance, in the qubit examples studied above, $N(t)$ is related to the heat exchanged with the bath (in the case of quantum jumps) or to the work performed by a Rabi drive (in the case of quantum diffusion). An agent with access to either of these quantities could then devise a strategy such as \u201cstop the process whenever a certain amount of work has been extracted.\u201d This has interesting thermodynamic impli-\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"2.

Different from previous schemes realized by dipolar exchange interaction and Floquet engineering [22], our approach is based on Rydberg dressing of an Ising Hamiltonian, which can offer a large and widely tunable anisotropy. In the current experiment, we focused on the single-magnon and the two-magnon sector. By creating more excitations in a large-scale array, the system may allow exploration of emergent Hilbert space fragmentation [39] and the Krylov-restricted thermalization of multiple magnons [9]. The scheme also allows dynamical engineering of spin transport, topological pumping protocols and programmable entanglement distributions [8]. Generalizations to higher dimension could lead to richer physics. In particular, in a 2D lattice, the inclusion of a multicolor dressing field could enable application of a synthetic gauge flux [41], which can give rise to topologically protected chiral motion of the magnon-bound state and holds promise for observation of a chiral spin liquid [42].\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThis research was supported by Samsung Science and Technology Foundation (SSTF-BA1301-52) and National Research Foundation of Korea (2017R1E1A1A01074307).

For reference, a larger qubit spacing $x/a = 2$ as well as the case where the qubits are all coupled to the same cavity ($x/a = 0$) are discussed in the text.

Effective spin Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{spin}}$\\n\\nAs mentioned above, we focus on negative detunings such that the energy of two excited qubits is in resonance with the band gap. We find that the band gap physics in the two-excitation manifold is well described by the spin Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{spin}}$, which is derived by adiabatically eliminating the photon degrees of freedom in a two-step process (see Appendix A for details). We emphasize that the approach taken here is distinct from the master equation approach pursued in Ref. [45]. The first step is, in spirit, identical to prior work [45\u201347]. Neglecting the two-photon scattering continuum and adiabatically eliminating the single-photon states, effective constrained single-qubit hopping interactions of strength $W_{ij}$ (see $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{single}}$ below), effective interactions between states with two and no qubit excitations [$F_{K,b}$ in Eq. (A12)], and effective interactions between two two-photon bound states with wave vector $K$ and $K'$ [$G_{K,K'}$ in Eq. (A13)] arise. While the latter two interactions were discussed in Refs. [45\u201347], the effective qubit hopping interaction was not. The reason is that Refs. [45\u201347] focused on $N_e = 2$ ($\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{single}}$ vanishes for $N_e = 2$). The hopping Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{single}}$ reads\\n\\n$$\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{single}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i,j,l=1}^{N_e} \\\\left( W_{ij} \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_i^+ \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_j^+ \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_l^- \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_l^- + W_{ij} \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_i^- \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_j^- \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_l^+ \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_l^+ \\\\right). \\\\quad (7)$$\\n\\nSince the triple sum includes terms where two or three of the indices are equal, the order of the operators in Eq. (7) is important. As discussed in more detail below, $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{single}}$ describes constrained single-qubit hopping or constrained flip-flop interactions. We find that the effective interactions $G_{K,K'}$ contribute negligibly to the band gap physics considered in this work; thus, they are set to zero.\\n\\nCalculations that treat the full Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}$ show that the photonic contribution to the eigenstates is smaller than 10% for the parameter combinations considered in this work. This motivates our second approximation, namely, the adiabatic elimination of the states $B_{ij}^l [g, \\\\cdots, g, \\\\text{vac}]$, i.e., basis kets that describe a photon pair with wave vector $K$, with the qubits in the ground state. Step two yields the effective spin Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{spin}}$ (see Appendix A for details),\\n\\n$$\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{spin}} = \\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{single}} + \\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{pair}}, \\\\quad (8)$$\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n$$\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{pair}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N_e-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^{N_e} \\\\sum_{l=1}^{N_e-1} \\\\sum_{h=l+1}^{N_e} Y_{ij, lh} \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_i^+ \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_j^+ \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_l^- \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_h^- \\\\quad (9)$$\\n\\nThe effective four-qubit (or two-qubit hopping) interactions $Y_{ij, lh}$ emerge from the interactions $F_{K,b}$ (see below).

Based on this, we investigate a more stealthy quantum attack where the eavesdroppers simulate random fluctuations of local oscillator intensity in a practical discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system. Theoretical simulations show that both communicating parties will misestimate channel parameters and overestimate the secret key rate due to the modified attack model, even though they have monitored the mean local oscillator intensity and shot-noise as commonly used. Specifically, the eavesdropper\u2019s manipulation of random fluctuations in LO intensity disturbs the parameter estimation in realistic discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system, where the experimental parameters are always used for constraints of the semidefinite program modeling. The modified attack introduced by random fluctuations of local oscillator can only be eliminated by monitoring the local oscillator intensity in real time which places a higher demand on the accuracy of monitoring technology. Moreover, similar quantum hacking will also occur in practical local oscillator system by manipulating the random fluctuations in pilot intensity, which shows the strong adaptability and the important role of the proposed attack.\\n\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nQuantum key distribution (QKD) [1] relies on quantum mechanical properties to ensure communication security, which allows two remote parties to generate unconditionally secure keys despite the presence of potential eavesdroppers in quantum channels [2, 3]. Depending on the dimension of coding, it can be divided into discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) and continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) [4, 5]. Between them, CV-QKD uses coherent detection technology to replace single-photon detection technology, which can be well compatible with classical optical communication systems [6]. In addition, the transmission distance achieved recently can support the requirement in metropolitan distances [7\u20139] which facilitates the large-scale application of QKD [10? ?\u201314].\\n\\nCV-QKD based on Gaussian-modulation (GM) [15\u201325] is widely used, where the quadratures of quantum states are modulated according to the Gaussian probability distribution. Moreover, discrete-modulated (DM) CV-QKD [26], where the quadratures of quantum states are modulated discretely, has also been gaining a lot of attention. Due to the simplicity of state preparation [9, 27, 28] and lower complexity of classical error correction [29, 30], the unconditional security of DM CV-QKD protocols (e.g., two-state and three-state protocols [31, 32]) has been successively proved. Recently, one of its security analysis theory is using the semidefinite program (SDP) model to give the lower bound of the secret key rate [33\u201337], and related experiments have also been carried out [9, 29, 38]. With the tremendous progress in theory and experiment of DM CV-QKD in recent years, its practical system security has received increasing attention. Different from theoretical analysis, the transmission of the local oscillator in the practical DM CV-QKD system would leave Eve with vulnerabilities to perform quantum hacking.\\n\\nThe local oscillator (LO) is required for stable coherent detection, whose non-ideality within practical environments is usually ignored in the security analysis of CV-QKD. Due to the imperfection of practical blocks and devices, researchers have proposed many quantum hacking models aiming at practical LO, such as local oscillator calibration attack [39], local oscillator intensity fluctuation attack [40], wavelength attacks [41, 42], polarization attack [43] and so on. Particularly, the transmission of LO opens a security vulnerability which gives eavesdropper (Eve) advantages to exploit the fluctuation of LO intensity [44]. We note that in the previous studies [40], Eve is assumed to reduce the intensity of LO overall using variable attenuators which can easily be defended by commonly-used monitoring technology such as monitoring the LO intensity mean and optical power or monitoring the shot-noise. In other words, the above manipulation and monitoring of LO intensity is carried out on its overall mean. When Eve simulates random fluctuations in LO intensity with invariant mean value, a more serious security loophole appears because above mentioned monitoring techniques will fail.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a modified local oscillator intensity attack (LOIA) with random fluctuations.

Process functions correspond to deterministic classical examples of such channels. Therefore, what remains to be shown is that the channel from $a'_k$ to $b_k$ obtained when we compose the original process matrix $W$ with the local circuit fragments involving the instruments (1) and (3), is deterministic, i.e., for every $a'$ that the parties may send out to the environment through their (classical) output systems, they receive a specific $b$ through their input systems with probability 1. We have already seen that when the parties output a specific $a' = \\\\bar{a}$ (which is what the instrument (2) in our protocol does), we obtain a specific $\\\\bar{b}$ with probability 1. But we still have to argue that the outcome $b_k$ of the L\u00fcders instrument (1) would be deterministic given $\\\\bar{a}$. This was true by construction in our procedure for replacing the original instrument of party $S_k$, but it assumed fixed operations of the other parties. Although we proved that if we replace the operations of all parties the total correlation will not change, we have not shown explicitly that the supports of the states $\\\\rho_{a_k,b_k}$ received by a given party $S_k$ could not go out of the respective $\\\\mathcal{H}^{b_k}$ when we replace the operations of other parties. It is a priori conceivable that the outcome $b_k$ of the L\u00fcders instrument (1) could become random upon such a replacement as long as all outcomes $b_k$ that may occur with nonzero probability for a fixed $\\\\bar{a}$ produce the same $x_k$ when inserted in the classical instrument (2) together with $a_k$. But by construction the instrument (2) produces the outcome $x_k = f_k^b(a_k, b_k)$ when applied on inputs $a_k$ and $b_k$, and by definition the function $f_k^b$ is such that for $b_k \\\\neq b'_k$ there would be at least one value of $a_k$ such that $f_k^b(a_k, b_k) \\\\neq f_k^b(a_k, b'_k)$. Since the received value of $b_k$ that would be plugged in instrument (2) is independent of $a_k$ (since in the process matrix framework no party can signal to their own input), it is impossible for party $S_k$ to receive two (or more) different values of $b_k$ that would produce the same $x_k$ for every choice of $a_k$. Thus, the channel from $\\\\bar{a}'$ to $\\\\bar{b}$ that describes the newly defined locally diagonal process must be deterministic. It is given by\\n\\n$$p(\\\\bar{b}|\\\\bar{a}') = \\\\prod_k \\\\delta_{\\\\bar{b}_k, g_k(\\\\bar{a}')}.$$  \\n\\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 4. \\\\hfill \\\\Box\\n\\n2. Strict inclusions\\n\\nThe sets of correlations we have defined admit the following inclusion relations:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{DC} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{PC} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{QC}.$$  \\n\\nThe strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{PC} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QP}$ follows from the bipartite case since quantum correlations can violate bipartite causal inequalities [3, 18] but deterministically/probabilistically consistent correlations cannot do so in the bipartite case. Specifically, in the bipartite case, we have\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{DC}^{(2)} = \\\\mathcal{PC}^{(2)} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QP}^{(2)} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}^{(2)},$$  \\n\\nwhere we use the superscript to denote that these inclusion relations are specific to the bipartite case. The strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{QP}^{(2)} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}^{(2)}$ already follows from Appendix A of Ref. [16]: namely, that the binary input/output bipartite \u2018Guess Your Neighbour\u2019s Input\u2019 (GYNI) game cannot be won perfectly by any correlation realizable via finite-dimensional process matrices. Here we adopt a different strategy to prove the strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}$: namely, as a corollary to Theorem 4. Hence, we generalize the aforementioned unachievability of the correlation winning the GYNI game perfectly (which follows from Ref. [16]) to all deterministic noncausal correlations in the bipartite case and, indeed, all deterministic noncausal correlations unachievable by process functions in the general case.\\\\footnote{Later (Corollary 4), we will provide examples of provably unachievable deterministic noncausal correlations in the case of tripartite process functions: in principle, any such example can be used in proving Corollary 1.}\\n\\n**Corollary 1.** The set of quantum process correlations is strictly contained within the set of quasi-consistent correlations, i.e., $\\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}$.\\n\\n**Proof.** Since the correlations achievable with bipartite process matrices are always causal [3], it follows that bipartite process functions cannot achieve deterministic noncausal correlations, e.g., the correlation winning a bipartite GYNI game [18] perfectly, which is deterministic and noncausal. Hence, by Theorem 4, it is also impossible to achieve such deterministic noncausal correlations with a bipartite process matrix.\\n\\nIndeed, any example of a deterministic noncausal correlation that cannot be achieved by a process function allows, via Theorem 4, to demonstrate the strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}$.

Therefore, what remains to be shown is that the channel from $a'_k$ to $b_k$ obtained when we compose the original process matrix $W$ with the local circuit fragments involving the instruments (1) and (3), is deterministic, i.e., for every $a'$ that the parties may send out to the environment through their (classical) output systems, they receive a specific $b$ through their input systems with probability 1. We have already seen that when the parties output a specific $a' = \\\\bar{a}$ (which is what the instrument (2) in our protocol does), we obtain a specific $\\\\bar{b}$ with probability 1. But we still have to argue that the outcome $b_k$ of the L\u00a8uders instrument (1) would be deterministic given $\\\\bar{a}$. This was true by construction in our procedure for replacing the original instrument of party $S_k$, but it assumed fixed operations of the other parties. Although we proved that if we replace the operations of all parties the total correlation will not change, we have not shown explicitly that the supports of the states $\\\\rho_{a_k,b_k}$ received by a given party $S_k$ could not go out of the respective $\\\\mathcal{H}^{b_k}$ when we replace the operations of other parties. It is a priori conceivable that the outcome $b_k$ of the L\u00a8uders instrument (1) could become random upon such a replacement as long as all outcomes $b_k$ that may occur with nonzero probability for a fixed $\\\\bar{a}$ produce the same $x_k$ when inserted in the classical instrument (2) together with $a_k$. But by construction the instrument (2) produces the outcome $x_k = f_k^b(a_k, b_k)$ when applied on inputs $a_k$ and $b_k$, and by definition the function $f_k^b$ is such that for $b_k \\\\neq b'_k$ there would be at least one value of $a_k$ such that $f_k^b(a_k, b_k) \\\\neq f_k^b(a_k, b'_k)$. Since the received value of $b_k$ that would be plugged in instrument (2) is independent of $a_k$ (since in the process matrix framework no party can signal to their own input), it is impossible for party $S_k$ to receive two (or more) different values of $b_k$ that would produce the same $x_k$ for every choice of $a_k$. Thus, the channel from $\\\\bar{a}'$ to $\\\\bar{b}$ that describes the newly defined locally diagonal process must be deterministic. It is given by\\n\\n$$p(\\\\bar{b}|\\\\bar{a}') = \\\\prod_k \\\\delta_{\\\\bar{b}_k, g_k(\\\\bar{a}')}.$$  \\n\\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 4. \\\\hfill \\\\Box\\n\\n2. Strict inclusions\\n\\nThe sets of correlations we have defined admit the following inclusion relations: \\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{DC} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{PC} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{QC}.$$  \\n\\nThe strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{PC} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QP}$ follows from the bipartite case since quantum process correlations can violate bipartite causal inequalities [3, 18] but deterministically/probabilistically consistent correlations cannot do so in the bipartite case. Specifically, in the bipartite case, we have\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{DC}^{(2)} = \\\\mathcal{PC}^{(2)} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QP}^{(2)} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}^{(2)},$$  \\n\\nwhere we use the superscript to denote that these inclusion relations are specific to the bipartite case. The strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{QP}^{(2)} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}^{(2)}$ already follows from Appendix A of Ref. [16]: namely, that the binary input/output bipartite \u2018Guess Your Neighbour\u2019s Input\u2019 (GYNI) game cannot be won perfectly by any correlation realizable via finite-dimensional process matrices. Here we adopt a different strategy to prove the strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}$: namely, as a corollary to Theorem 4. Hence, we generalize the aforementioned unachievability of the correlation winning the GYNI game perfectly (which follows from Ref. [16]) to all deterministic noncausal correlations in the bipartite case and, indeed, all deterministic noncausal correlations unachievable by process functions in the general case. 29\\n\\n**Corollary 4), we will provide examples of provably un-achievable deterministic noncausal correlations in the case of tripartite process functions: in principle, any such example can be used in proving Corollary 1.**\\n\\n**Corollary 1.** The set of quantum process correlations is strictly contained within the set of quasi-consistent correlations, i.e., $\\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}$.\\n\\n**Proof.** Since the correlations achievable with bipartite process matrices are always causal [3], it follows that bipartite process functions cannot achieve deterministic noncausal correlations, e.g., the correlation winning a bipartite GYNI game [18] perfectly, which is deterministic and noncausal. Hence, by Theorem 4, it is also impossible to achieve such deterministic noncausal correlations with a bipartite process matrix.\\n\\nIndeed, any example of a deterministic noncausal correlation that cannot be achieved by a process function allows, via Theorem 4, to demonstrate the strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{QP} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{QC}$. Examples of such correlations in the tripartite case are shown further on in Corollary 4. \\\\hfill \\\\Box\\n\\nWe defer a formal proof of the strict inclusion $\\\\mathcal{DC} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{PC}$ until later (see Theorem 5).\\n\\n3.

Physically, the problem amounts to solving for the dynamics of an entire quantum field, where each field degree of freedom (i.e., mode) occupies a bosonic Fock space. Even if we discretize the field to $M$ modes and truncate the Fock space of each mode to $D$ dimensions (i.e., allowing at most $D - 1$ photons per mode), the quantum state of the field lives in a $D^M$-dimensional (Hilbert) space, upon which operators such as $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{3wm}}$ and $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\text{lin}}$ act. A typical discretization of the classical field $\\\\psi(z)$ in the NSLE might employ $M = 1024$ points, but even just allowing one photon per mode at $D = 2$, we have, at least without the use of sophisticated model reduction techniques, a $2^{1024}$-dimensional problem!\\n\\nThe situation becomes greatly simplified, however, if we are able to focus our attention solely on the Gaussian moments of the state, namely the mean $\\\\langle \\\\hat{\\\\psi}_z \\\\rangle$ (corresponding to an $M$-dimensional vector when discretized) and the covariances $\\\\langle \\\\delta \\\\hat{\\\\psi}_z \\\\delta \\\\hat{\\\\psi}_{z'} \\\\rangle$ and $\\\\langle \\\\delta \\\\hat{\\\\psi}_z^\\\\dagger \\\\delta \\\\hat{\\\\psi}_{z'}^\\\\dagger \\\\rangle$ (each corresponding to an $M \\\\times M$ matrix). Thus, in a Gaussian framework, the numerical problem of solving for the quantum noise dynamics becomes $O(M^2)$-dimensional. As a result, our nonlinear Gaussian-state model has access to the same highly efficient numerical techniques employed by classical pulse propagation techniques, including the use of split-step methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and massively parallel computation on graphics processing units (GPUs). Specifically, just as the cost of evolving the field over one time step for the classical NLSE is well known to be limited by FFT to $O(M \\\\log M)$, our method does the same for the full Gaussian moments of the field with only cost $O(M^2 \\\\log M)$. This makes our method a natural generalization of the classical split-step Fourier (SSF) method, and we therefore refer to our numerical approach, when applied to the problem of ultrafast pulse propagation, as a nonlinear Gaussian-state SSF (GSSF) method.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nUnlike earlier discoveries in theoretical physics prior to 1925, Quantum Mechanics was the result of the efforts of more than one man, namely: Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, Dirac and Schr\u00f6dinger. It was indeed Heisenberg who made the first and major step in the discovery of Quantum Mechanics, his priority and legacy is therefore unquestionable. However, had he not made that step, it is clear from the historical developments that it would have been Schr\u00f6dinger who would claim priority, though his perspective using the de Broglie matter wave mechanical approach, though ubiquitous, had turned out to be incorrect eventually. Some physicists famously Weinberg and also Fermi, considered Heisenberg\u2019s paper of July 1925 incomprehensible because it was clouded in mystery as to why he made the assumptions that he did and what motivated the steps in his thinking. In 2004 Aitchison et al made an attempt to provide an \u201cunderstanding\u201d of Heisenberg\u2019s July 1925 paper by filling in the apparent gaps in the calculational details (some omitted by Heisenberg in his 1925 paper) thereby making a reconstruction of this landmark paper.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nUnlike earlier discoveries in theoretical physics prior to 1925, Quantum Mechanics was the result of the efforts of more than one man, namely: Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, Dirac and Schr\u00a8odinger. It was indeed Heisenberg who made the first and major step in the discovery of Quantum Mechanics, his priority and legacy is therefore unquestionable 4 . However, had he not made that step, it is clear from the historical developments that it would have been Schr\u00a8odinger who would claim priority, though his perspective using the de Broglie matter wave mechanical approach, though ubiquitous, had turned out to be incorrect eventually. Some physicists famously Weinberg 6 and also Fermi 7 , considered Heisenberg\u2019s paper of July 1925 incomprehensible because it was clouded in mystery as to why he made the assumptions that he did and what motivated the steps in his thinking. In 2004 Aitchison et al 8 made an attempt to provide an \u201cunderstanding\u201d of Heisenberg\u2019s July 1925 paper by filling in the apparent gaps in the calculational details (some omitted by Heisenberg in his 1925 paper) thereby making a reconstruction of this landmark paper. While their effort is instructive and may be useful for the teaching of advanced courses in quantum mechanics, and may have relieved Weinberg\u2019s and Fermi\u2019s \u201cincomprehensibility\u201d objection, it has done little in my opinion to elucidate the \u201cmagical\u201d part of Weinberg\u2019s observations.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIncreasing the complexity of a light field and the control of different degrees of freedom (DoF\u2019s) is beneficial for advancing research and technology. Increasingly complex structures realized by combining several DoF\u2019s have been studied in a myriad of experiments over the last decades and the enhanced understanding of the interplay of the DoF\u2019s has already enabled novel photonic technologies [1\u20136]. Initially, many experiments have studied structuring transverse light fields as well as shaping the temporal profile of pulses, both in its scalar forms, i.e. with a uniform polarization structure [7, 8]. The complexity of the light field\u2019s structure was further increased by including the polarization domain leading to beams with spatially non-uniform polarization distributions, i.e. spatial vector beams, as well as a temporally varying polarization vector across the pulse duration. Over the last years, this approach has been extended to combine all DoF\u2019s, e.g. the study of advanced spatio-temporal pulses of vectorial light fields [9]. Interestingly, the focus in most of the research efforts has been to generate complex polarization and spatial patterns over the temporal domain of light with much less attention to studying structured light fields in the time\u2019s complementary DoF, i.e. the spectral domain. Correlating polarization with the wavelength of a light pulse, for example, can be used for advanced sensing and pulse characterization schemes [10\u201314].\\n\\nHere, we extend the idea of spatial and spectral vector beams by combining all three DoF\u2019s, namely polarization, space, and wavelength of the light field. We term such light pulses spatio-spectral vector beams (SSVB\u2019s), which are light fields with a varying polarization structure in space as well as wavelength as shown in Fig. 1 a). Using a simple setup consisting of only three optical elements placed along a single beam line, we are able to generate highly complex pulses of light for which any given wavelength (or transverse angular position) the light field shows a different spatial (or spectral) polarization pattern. We further show that all three DoF\u2019s are non-separable and the complex vectorial nature of the light field can only be observed when all DoF\u2019s are resolved. By integrating over the light\u2019s transverse spatial extend or wavelength spectrum (or both), the beam would be seemingly unpolarized. Finally, we detail the analogy of such complex structured light fields to the Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which describes three entangled particles in quantum optics. Here, the DoF\u2019s of the classical light field act as the different quantum states in the GHZ description. We expect that the complexity of SSVB\u2019s combined with the ease of our generation technique will trigger novel studies on structured light fields and advance their applications in novel spectroscopy, imaging, or sensing technologies.\\n\\n![Conceptual idea.

Increasingly complex structures realized by combining several DoF\u2019s have been studied in a myriad of experiments over the last decades and the enhanced understanding of the interplay of the DoF\u2019s has already enabled novel photonic technologies [1\u20136]. Initially, many experiments have studied structuring transverse light fields as well as shaping the temporal profile of pulses, both in its scalar forms, i.e. with a uniform polarization structure [7, 8]. The complexity of the light field\u2019s structure was further increased by including the polarization domain leading to beams with spatially non-uniform polarization distributions, i.e. spatial vector beams, as well as a temporally varying polarization vector across the pulse duration. Over the last years, this approach has been extended to combine all DoF\u2019s, e.g. the study of advanced spatio-temporal pulses of vectorial light fields [9]. Interestingly, the focus in most of the research efforts has been to generate complex polarization and spatial patterns over the temporal domain of light with much less attention to studying structured light fields in the time\u2019s complementary DoF, i.e. the spectral domain. Correlating polarization with the wavelength of a light pulse, for example, can be used for advanced sensing and pulse characterization schemes [10\u201314].\\n\\nHere, we extend the idea of spatial and spectral vector beams by combining all three DoF\u2019s, namely polarization, space, and wavelength of the light field. We term such light pulses spatio-spectral vector beams (SSVB\u2019s), which are light fields with a varying polarization structure in space as well as wavelength as shown in Fig. 1 a). Using a simple setup consisting of only three optical elements placed along a single beam line, we are able to generate highly complex pulses of light for which any given wavelength (or transverse angular position) the light field shows a different spatial (or spectral) polarization pattern. We further show that all three DoF\u2019s are non-separable and the complex vectorial nature of the light field can only be observed when all DoF\u2019s are resolved. By integrating over the light\u2019s transverse spatial extend or wavelength spectrum (or both), the beam would be seemingly unpolarized. Finally, we detail the analogy of such complex structured light fields to the Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which describes three entangled particles in quantum optics. Here, the DoF\u2019s of the classical light field act as the different quantum states in the GHZ description. We expect that the complexity of SSVB\u2019s combined with the ease of our generation technique will trigger novel studies on structured light fields and advance their applications in novel spectroscopy, imaging, or sensing technologies.\\n\\n![Conceptual idea. A simple generation scheme consisting only of a birefringent crystal, a quarter wave-plate (QWP), and a vortex-retarder generates a complex light field where polarization, wavelength, and space are correlated.

As a result of the interesting performance of this decoder, several studies discussing ML decoders for the rotated planar code have been proposed such as the deep neural network based decoder in (Chamberland and Ronagh, 2018; Varsamopoulos et al., 2020b) or the reinforcement learning based decoder in (Sweke et al., 2020). The deep neural network decoder proved a better threshold than MWPM at the cost of a higher complexity, while the reinforcement learning decoder proved an almost linear complexity at the cost of a worse code threshold (Varsamopoulos et al., 2020b). Combinations of NN decoders with RG decoders have also been proposed (Varsamopoulos et al., 2020a). Machine learning based decoding methods have also been proposed for other topological codes such as the toric code (Andreason et al., 2019; Domingo Colomer et al., 2020; Fitzek et al., 2020; Krastanov and Jiang, 2017; Liu and Poulin, 2019; Meinerz et al., 2022; Ni, 2020; Torlai and Melko, 2017; Wagner et al., 2020), the color code (Baireuther et al., 2019) or the semionic code (Varona and Martin-Delgado, 2020).

In a similar fashion as other decoders, dealing with noisy measurements requires approximately \\\\( d \\\\) syndrome measurement rounds, implying that the runtime of the decoders increases. Importantly, NN decoder should be trained using this error model so that they can cope with it, i.e. training is specific to the noise model in consideration (Varsamopoulos et al., 2017).

Some of the problematic behind this family of decoders is the training cost, which may scale exponentially with the code distance (Vasmer et al., 2021). This is one of the main reasons behind the fact that most of the NN-based decoders have only been tested for small distances \\\\( d < 10 \\\\) (Meinerz et al., 2022). Interestingly, promising results have been obtained for decoding the toric code with an NN+UF decoder that achieves high threshold with almost linear complexity, while having been tested up to \\\\( d = 255 \\\\) (Meinerz et al., 2022). However, the need of a training stage before operation implies that NN and ML decoders might not be the best choice when the noise fluctuates over time, as it occurs for superconducting qubit platforms (Etxezarreta Martinez et al., 2021; Etxezarreta Martinez et al., 2023). Additionally, it is important to state that mapping the decoding problem to a ML classification problem works well for the rotated planar code or other topological codes since they encode a low number of logical qubits, implying that the possible logical errors is not too high. However, since the number of logical errors scales as \\\\( 2^k \\\\) with the number of logical qubits (Fuentes et al., 2022), these methods may not be implementable for other families of codes with higher coding rates such as QLDPC codes.\\n\\n4. MaxSAT decoder\\n\\nThe MaxSAT decoder has been recently proposed as an efficient algorithm to decode color codes (Berent et al., 2023a). This decoder is based on the analogy between the decoding problem of the color code and the LightsOut puzzle when the error model in consideration is the bit-flip noise. The LightsOut puzzle refers to a problem where a lattice whose faces are associated with switches and lights can be either on or off. In such lattice, toggling a switch on the lattice implies that all its neighbouring lights change their previous state, i.e. if they were on they are turned of and vice versa. The LightsOut problem then tries to find out a sequence of switch actions so that all lights are turned off. The puzzle has two important properties: toggling a switch twice is the same as not doing anything and the state of a light only depends on how often its neighbour switch have been toggled (independence on the order). The authors argue that this problem is similar to the decoding process of a color code by doing the following analogy:\\n\\n- Data qubits \u2194 switches.\\n- Checks \u2194 lights.\\n- Syndrome \u2194 initial light configuration.\\n- Decoding estimate \u2194 switch set that is a solution.\\n- Minimum-weight decoding estimate \u2194 solution with minimum switch operations.\\n\\nTherefore, the authors exploit such an analogy to propose a decoding methods based on solving the LightsOut puzzle. The main idea is to find the minimal solution set for the puzzle, which is equivalent to a decoding estimate of minimum weight matching the syndrome measurement. In order to obtain the minimal solution of the LightsOut puzzle, the authors formulate such problem as a maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem, which generally refers to the problem of determining the maximum number of clauses of a Boolean function that can be made\"}\n\n "], "olmocr": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"proved to be an efficient method for decoding small distance, \\\\( d \\\\in \\\\{3, 5, 7\\\\} \\\\), rotated planar codes achieving similar performance as the MWPM decoder while maintaining a similar complexity.

It has been shown that the such created one-dimensional lattice shows emergent periodic behavior, i.e. it consists of a transient whose length depends on the concrete values of \\\\( n, m \\\\) followed by a subsequent periodic behavior. By construction, the local symmetries of this lattice are strongly overlapping. A spectral analysis of the tight-binding (TB) realization of the \\\\( n : m \\\\) LSD chains demonstrated the control possibilities of the localization properties of the eigenstates by the nested local symmetries.\\n\\nIn the present work we go one step further and establish a type of rule which does not possess emergent periodicity but leads to a scaling behavior of the chain. As a consequence we have similar repeating units along the lattice but, in each step, they are stretched with respect to their lengths i.e. the number of sites is correspondingly increased. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of a TB implementation of the scaled chain. The eigenvalue spectrum shows a distinct transition from two to three branches and finally to a single branch with increasing off-diagonal coupling strength. The fluctuations of the energy level spacings cover several orders of magnitude and exhibit minigaps. A density of state analysis shows a strongly peaked behavior at the crossover points of the branches. We develop a local resonator model which allows us to interpret and understand this spectral behavior. Our eigenstate analysis demonstrates the unique localization properties of this scaled chain and in particular their variation with changing coupling strength. Finally we investigate the energy-dependent transmission profile by attaching leads to the scaled chain. It shows a transition from few to many isolated complete transmission peaks and finally, for smaller values of the coupling, we observe a decreasing spectral transmission window with an irregular fluctuating behavior.\\n\\nThis work is structured as follows. In section II we introduce our LSD rule and the resulting scaled chain and map it onto a TB Hamiltonian. Section III presents an analysis of the energy eigenvalue spectrum of scaled chains including the energy spacing distributions and density of states. In section IV we develop the local resonator model which offers a deeper understanding of the spectral properties and we compare it to the TB results. Section V provides an analysis of the eigenstates including their localization behavior. The transmission properties of our scaled chain are explored in section VI with varying coupling strength. Finally, in section VII we present our conclusions.\\n\\nII. THE SCALED LSD CHAIN: SETUP AND HAMILTONIAN\\n\\nThe local symmetry dynamics (LSD) represents a concept which allows us to generate lattices with local symmetries starting from a given initial condition, i.e. from an initial finite segment of a lattice. One important way to achieve this is to perform reflection operations of a certain domain size at the end of a given finite lattice.

It has been shown that the such created one-dimensional lattice shows emergent periodic behavior, i.e. it consists of a transient whose length depends on the concrete values of \\\\( n, m \\\\) followed by a subsequent periodic behavior. By construction, the local symmetries of this lattice are strongly overlapping. A spectral analysis of the tightbinding (TB) realization of the \\\\( n : m \\\\) LSD chains demonstrated the control possibilities of the localization properties of the eigenstates by the nested local symmetries. In the present work we go one step further and establish a type of rule which does not possess emergent periodicity but leads to a scaling behavior of the chain. As a consequence we have similar repeating units along the lattice but, in each step, they are stretched with respect to their lengths i.e. the number of sites is correspondingly increased. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of a TB implementation of the scaled chain. The eigenvalue spectrum shows a distinct transition from two to three branches and finally to a single branch with increasing off-diagonal coupling strength. The fluctuations of the energy level spacings cover several orders of magnitude and exhibit minigaps. A density of state analysis shows a strongly peaked behavior at the crossover points of the branches. We develop a local resonator model which allows us to interpret and understand this spectral behavior. Our eigenstate analysis demonstrates the unique localization properties of this scaled chain and in particular their variation with changing coupling strength. Finally we investigate the energy-dependent transmission profile by attaching leads to the scaled chain. It shows a transition from few to many isolated complete transmission peaks and finally, for smaller values of the coupling, we observe a decreasing spectral transmission window with an irregular fluctuating behavior. This work is structured as follows. In section II we introduce our LSD rule and the resulting scaled chain and map it onto a TB Hamiltonian. Section III presents an analysis of the energy eigenvalue spectrum of scaled chains including the energy spacing distributions and density of states. In section IV we develop the local resonator model which offers a deeper understanding of the spectral properties and we compare it to the TB results. Section V provides an analysis of the eigenstates including their localization behavior. The transmission properties of our scaled chain are explored in section VI with varying coupling strength. Finally, in section VII we present our conclusions. \\n\\nII. THE SCALED LSD CHAIN: SETUP AND HAMILTONIAN\\n\\nThe local symmetry dynamics (LSD) represents a concept which allows us to generate lattices with local symmetries starting from a given initial condition, i.e. from an initial finite segment of a lattice. One important way to achieve this is to perform reflection operations of a certain domain size at the end of a given finite lattice. In ref.[20] the special case of the \\\\( n : m \\\\) rules, where \\\\( n, m \\\\) stand for the number of sites to be reflected alternatingly, has been investigated: it provides us with emergent periodicity in the sense that a spatially evolving transient is followed by a periodic behavior of the lattice.

A summary of several protocols and their associated costs is provided in Ref. [19].\\n\\nWhen choosing a suitable protocol, there are multiple factors that we need to consider. First, we need to consider the overall logical failure probability from faulty $|T\\\\rangle$ state generation.

This depends on both the number of QEC rounds required to generate the $|T\\\\rangle$ states, but also the number of QEC rounds required to implement these logical operations. If we implement Clifford gates directly as described in Section III B, the circuit primarily consists of alternating sequences of Hadamard gates, which take $3d+4$ QEC rounds, and $T$-like gates, which take between $d+1$ and $5d/2 + 4$ QEC rounds, depending on whether or not an $S$ gate correction is required. This means that when implementing Clifford gates directly, a $|T\\\\rangle$ state needs to be produced at least once every $4d + 5$ QEC rounds. In comparison, when Clifford operations have been moved through the circuit as described in Section III C, the only operations required are a single joint Pauli measurement and a single $X$ basis measurement, meaning that a $|T\\\\rangle$ state must be produced every $d + 1$ QEC rounds. If a single distillation protocol cannot generate states fast enough, multiple instances of the protocol can be run in parallel to generate states more frequently, at the cost of increasing the number of physical qubits [12]. As we show in Appendix D, up to four factories can be placed around the two corners at the top of the routing space. It is possible to add even more factories beyond these four, but doing so could require additional space for routing and storage of $|T\\\\rangle$ states.

UNDERSTANDING UNCONVENTIONAL TOPOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF COUNTER-ROTATING TERM\\n\\nMost TPTs in the anisotropic QRM are conventional ones [28] which occur with gap closing as those in condensed matter [91, 96\u2013101]. Unconventional TPTs without gap closing also exist [29, 30] analogously to the unconventional cases in the quantum spin Hall effect with strong electron-electron interactions [102] and the quantum anomalous Hall effect with disorder [103]. These unconventional TPTs lie in the ground state by a mechanism of node introduction from the infinity [29, 30]. On the other hand, it is found that unconventional TPTs emerge more frequently in excited states, especially around level anti-crossings [31]. Here from the JC-Stark model we can gain some insight for the origin of such unconventional TPTs in excited states.\\n\\nIn Fig. 6 panel (a) shows the energy spectrum of the JC-Stark model, where levels are crossing among all the states with negative parity (blue solid) and positive parity (red dotted). Panel (b) gives the spin winding number $n_w$ (solid line) of the ground state ($j_E = 1$) which jumps always at parity variation (dotted line) and gap closing (similar to the solid line in panel (f)). The spin winding can turn direction in excited states, as indicated by the negative values of $n_w$ in panel (d) for state $j_E = 20$ according to the discussion in Sect. IV G. Each jump of $n_w$ is accompanied with a TPT. In particular, some TPTs occur without parity variation, as illustrated in panel (c) for state $j_E = 2$, which comes from the level crossing between same parity states. Note here the gap is still closing at the transitions despite no parity variation. What interesting is, once we add anisotropy, e.g. $\\\\lambda = 0.01$, the gap at these TPTs opens, as demonstrated by the energy spectrum by panel (b) and more clearly by the dotted line in panel (f). This gap opening accounts for the afore-mentioned unconventional TPTs in the excited.\\n\\nA clearer explanation can be given by regarding the counter-rotating term as a perturbation around these transitions which mainly involves the two level-crossing states $\\\\psi_n^{(z,\\\\eta)}, \\\\psi_{n'}^{(z,\\\\eta')}$ with energies $\\\\varepsilon_1 = E^{(n,\\\\eta)}, \\\\varepsilon_2 = E^{(n',\\\\eta')}$ and winding numbers $n_{w,1} = -\\\\eta n, n_{w,2} = -\\\\eta' n'$.

Notice that in this case, we do not have analytic expressions for the size of the largest Krylov sector as in the case of $r = 1$. So we implement the recursive algorithm outlined in the main text, which works independent of the range $r$. The ratio $D_{\\\\text{max}}/D_{\\\\text{sum}}$ exhibits a qualitative change at the critical density $n_c \\\\approx 0.33$ [Fig. 6(a)]. For $n < n_c$, the largest Krylov sector constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the full symmetry sector in the thermodynamic limit, indicative of strong fragmentation. The ratio decays exponentially with $L$ upon increasing system size in this regime [Fig. 6(b)]. For $n > n_c$, the ratio approaches order one, indicating weak fragmentation, and the system thermalizes with high probability from a random initial state. At the critical point, $D_{\\\\text{max}}/D_{\\\\text{sum}}$ again shows a power-law decay with system size as $L^{-1}$. We can similarly consider the fraction of frozen sites averaged over all configurations in a symmetry sector as a function of the filling, which serves as an order parameter for the transition. This order parameter changes from zero to nonzero at the critical $n_c$, as shown in Fig. 6(d). Notice that the position of the critical point is again in excellent agreement with the general expression $n_c = \\\\frac{1}{r+1}$, which is equal to $1/3$ for $r = 2$.\\n\\nWe also consider the process of thermal inclusion in this case, for which numerical results are summarized in Fig. 7.

For example, the 3d cubic lattice fusion complex maps to the 3d subsystem toric code of Ref. [89]. Thus, the fusion complex framework gives a constructive and generative way to generalize the subsystem toric code (STC) models of Refs. [89, 90], providing a family of examples of 3d single-shot error correcting codes that have been of recent interest [88\u201392].\\n\\nA subsystem code [93, 94] is specified by a (not-necessarily commuting) subgroup of Pauli operators \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) called the gauge group.

Thus in particular, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\), such that stabilizer outcomes can be inferred by measuring gauge generators. Some subsystem codes, like gauge color codes and subsystem toric codes, allow \u201cgauge fixing\u201d between different stabilizer codes (meaning the target stabilizer code is described by a subgroup of the gauge group) [95, 96]. Here we show that any fusion complex with bi-colorable vertices can be used to define a subsystem toric code.\\n\\n**Definition 6.** (3d subsystem-toric-code complex) A 3-dimensional cell complex, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\{C, F, E, V\\\\} \\\\), is a subsystem-toric-code complex if every edge has exactly four incident faces, and it has bi-colorable vertices.\\n\\nThe subsystem code is defined on such a complex as follows (recall that the 3-cells are also bicolorable by construction).\\n\\n- A qubit is associated to each 1-cell \\\\( e \\\\in E \\\\).\\n- A gauge generator \\\\( g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) is associated to each corner of a 3-cell, and is \\\\( X \\\\)-type or \\\\( Z \\\\)-type according to the color of the 3-cell.\\n- A stabilizer \\\\( s \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\) is associated to each 3-cell \\\\( c \\\\in C \\\\), and is \\\\( X \\\\)-type or \\\\( Z \\\\)-type according to the color of the 3-cell.\\n\\nIn particular, the stabilizers for each 3-cell \\\\( c \\\\in C \\\\) are a product of either \\\\( X \\\\) or \\\\( Z \\\\) (depending on the color of \\\\( c \\\\)) on all qubits supported on edges of that cell. To define the gauge generators, take an \\\\( X \\\\)-type (\\\\( Z \\\\)-type) 3-cell \\\\( c \\\\in C \\\\), and a vertex \\\\( v \\\\) supported on \\\\( c \\\\). Then the gauge generator \\\\( g_{(v,c)} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) associated to the corner \\\\( (v,c) \\\\) of the 3-cell is given by a product of \\\\( X \\\\) (\\\\( Z \\\\)) operators on all qubits supported on the edges of \\\\( c \\\\) that are incident to \\\\( v \\\\).

For example, the 3d cubic lattice fusion complex maps to the 3d subsystem toric code of Ref. [89]. Thus, the fusion complex framework gives a constructive and generative way to generalize the subsystem toric code (STC) models of Refs. [89, 90], providing a family of examples of 3d single-shot error correcting codes that have been of recent interest [88\u201392].\\n\\nA subsystem code [93, 94] is specified by a (not-necessarily commuting) subgroup of Pauli operators \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) called the gauge group.

Here we show that any fusion complex with bi-colorable vertices can be used to define a subsystem toric code. \\n\\n**Definition 6.** (3d subsystem-toric-code complex) A 3- dimensional cell complex, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\{C, F, E, V\\\\} \\\\), is a subsystem-toric-code complex if every edge has exactly four incident faces, and it has bi-colorable vertices. \\n\\nThe subsystem code is defined on such a complex as follows (recall that the 3-cells are also bicolorable by construction). \\n\\n- A qubit is associated to each 1-cell \\\\( e \\\\in E \\\\).\\n- A gauge generator \\\\( g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) is associated to each corner of a 3-cell, and is \\\\( X \\\\)-type or \\\\( Z \\\\)-type according to the color of the 3-cell. \\n- A stabilizer \\\\( s \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\) is associated to each 3-cell \\\\( c \\\\in C \\\\), and is \\\\( X \\\\)-type or \\\\( Z \\\\)-type according to the color of the 3-cell. \\n\\nIn particular, the stabilizers for each 3-cell \\\\( c \\\\in C \\\\) are a product of either \\\\( X \\\\) or \\\\( Z \\\\) (depending on the color of \\\\( c \\\\)) on all qubits supported on edges of that cell. To define the gauge generators, take an \\\\( X \\\\)-type (\\\\( Z \\\\)-type) 3-cell \\\\( c \\\\in C \\\\), and a vertex \\\\( v \\\\) supported on \\\\( c \\\\). Then the gauge generator \\\\( g_{(v,c)} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) associated to the corner \\\\( (v,c) \\\\) of the 3-cell is given by a product of \\\\( X \\\\) (\\\\( Z \\\\)) operators on all qubits supported on the edges of \\\\( c \\\\) that are incident to \\\\( v \\\\).

We compared samples generated by Gibbs sampling and quantum annealing with those calibrated by the proposed scheme. Table 1 shows the results of KL divergence. The increase in the size of samples decreased KL divergence because the empirical distributions approach the original distribution. In theory, Gibbs sampling can accurately obtain samples following the Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, results close to those obtained by Gibbs sampling can be considered more accurate.

We found that the increased number of internal parameters improved sample quality. To determine the reason, Fig. 3 presents histograms of the samples\u2019 energies. Although one parameter can adjust the total energy \\\\( E \\\\), the samples\u2019 distributions of \\\\( E_{vh} \\\\) and \\\\( E_v \\\\) exhibit differences between Gibbs sampling and quantum annealing. \\\\( E_v \\\\) of the three-parameter case and \\\\( E_{vh} \\\\) of one-and-all-bias case seem to fit well with Gibbs sampling. Quantum annealers have not only temperature differences, but imperfections of qubits.

As one of the most important bosonic codes, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is proposed to correct small displacement error in phase space. If the noise in phase space is biased, square-lattice GKP code can be concatenated with XZZX surface code or repetition code that promises a high fault-tolerant threshold to suppress the logical error. In this work, we study the performance of GKP repetition codes with physical ancillary GKP qubits in correcting biased noise. We find that there exists a critical value of noise variance for the ancillary GKP qubit such that the logical Pauli error rate decreases when increasing the code size. Furthermore, one round of GKP error correction has to be performed before concatenating with repetition code. Our study paves the way for practical implementation of error correction by concatenating GKP code with low-level qubit codes.\\n\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nNoise is the main hindrance to achieve large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. Quantum error correcting code is introduced to correct errors by using redundancy in the Hilbert space [1\u20133]. Bosonic codes protect finite-dimensional logical space by encoding it in an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system [4, 5], e.g., a simple harmonic oscillator. Compared to the standard qubit codes that encode a single logical qubit using many physical qubits, the bosonic code is more hardware efficient and is subject to a smaller number of noisy channels [6, 7]. Currently well established bosonic codes include Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code [8, 9], cat code [10, 11], binomial code [12\u201314], and rotation-symmetric code [15, 16]. The GKP code is one of the most promising bosonic codes, which corrects small displacement errors in phase space and also photon loss [6, 17]. Although the GKP code has been proposed for two decades [8], it is prepared only recently in ion-trapped [18, 19] and superconducting [20] platforms, and is used to extend the decoherence time of the logical qubit through error correction. The GKP code has promising advantages in optical quantum information processing [21], however optical GKP states have not been experimentally generated due to the stringent requirement for strong nonlinearity, though various preparation schemes have been proposed [22\u201326].\\n\\nIn order to achieve fault tolerance, the common strategy is to concatenate the GKP code with qubit codes to further suppress the logical error. Examples include concatenation with surface/toric codes [27\u201332], color code [33\u201335] etc. Concatenation with qubit codes with a high threshold enables a low squeezing threshold for the GKP states around 10 dB [27], which is within the reach of near-term technologies. A variant of the original surface code, known as the XZZX surface code [36], has recently been shown to have a higher threshold for biased noise. It is expected that concatenation of GKP code with XZZX surface code would enable lower squeezing threshold if the displacement error is biased [37]. This can happen in two cases, either the noise is biased and a square-lattice (isotropic) GKP code is used, or the noise is isotropic and a biased GKP code is used. However, syndrome measurement and decoding are still complicated for the XZZX surface code [38], which therefore consume more physical and computational resources. A relatively easier scheme to suppress biased noise is to concatenate GKP code with repetition code [39], which requires easier syndrome measurement and decoding, and has a higher threshold. In Ref. [39], the error threshold has been estimated for biased GKP repetition code with isotropic noise, which outperforms the biased planar surface code [29]. However, both the data and ancillary GKP qubits are assumed to be ideal, namely, with infinitely energy. The error threshold as derived in Ref.

The above state has quantum discord $D^+(\\\\rho_{AB}) > 0$ and $D^-(\\\\rho_{AB}) = 0$ (see Appendix B for the definition of quantum discord) since it is not a classical-quantum state but a quantum-classical state [ 11 , 12 ].

In particular, we can obtain upper bounds for the ratio $m/k$ in the transformation $\\\\rho^{\\\\otimes k} \\\\rightarrow \\\\sigma^{\\\\otimes m}$ under free operations. Moreover, the results on the relative entropy of magic allow us to derive upper bounds for asymptotic state transformation. In this way, we obtain much tighter bounds for one-shot state transformation than the one previously known, which used the generalized robustness. Moreover, we obtain new (closed-form) upper bounds for transformations involving specific two and three-qubit mixed states, e.g. the depolarized Toffoli state (see Section 6 for more details). We now summarize the main results of this work. \\n\\n- In Section 3 , we prove that the stabilizer fidelity is multiplicative for tensor products of any number of single-qubit states. We then extend this result to include a continuous set of magic monotones, namely all the $\\\\alpha$-z R\u00e9nyi relative entropies of magic in the range $|1 - \\\\alpha|/z = 1$. In this way, we also independently recover the multiplicativity of the generalized robustness of magic for all single-qubit states established in [ 32 ].\\n\\n- In Section 4 , we prove that the relative entropy of magic is additive for single-qubit states if all of them but one commute with their optimizer, i.e. the closest stabilizer state. Moreover, in Section 8 , we show that the latter class includes the $T, H$, and $F$ states subject to depolarizing noise. These are the states involved in the standard magic state distillation scenario where any initial state is first projected onto a symmetry axis of the octahedron by applying the stabilizer twirling, from which one aims to distill a better pure magic state [ 7 , 8 ]. We extend this result to all the $\\\\alpha$-z R\u00e9nyi relative entropies of magic. Finally, we also show that the relative entropy of magic is not additive for general two multi-qubit states by providing a counterexample. \\n\\n- In Section 5 , we prove that all the $\\\\alpha$-z R\u00e9nyi relative entropies of magic are additive for two and three-qubit states that belong to a specific class. In Section 8 , we show that the latter class includes the Toffoli, Hoggar, and $CS$ states subject to global depolarizing noise. \\n\\n- In Section 6 we discuss in detail the implication of the above additivity results to magic state transformation. This allows us to obtain upper bounds on magic state distillation and dilution. \\n\\n- In Section 7 , we give closed-form expressions for the stabilizer fidelity and the generalized robustness of magic for single-qubit states. The latter monotone benchmarks several proposed classical simulators (see [ 32 ] for more details). Moreover, for single-qubit states, the generalized robustness of magic is equal to the dyadic negativity and the mixed-state extent [ 32 , Theorem 3]. In Section 8 we give a closed-form expression for all the $\\\\alpha$-z R\u00e9nyi relative entropies of magic for $T, H, F$, Toffoli, Hoggar, and $CS$ magic states subject to global depolarizing noise.\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"Bohm and Hiley [13] criticized Nelson\u2019s theory for assuming a particular definition of the acceleration, which they felt was ad hoc, since other definitions are possible which nevertheless result in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, and which obey the time-reversal symmetry desired by Nelson.\\\\footnote{Yasue [44] has shown that Nelson\u2019s Second Law follows from a stochastic variational principle, together with the demand of positive semidefinite mean kinetic energy.} Instead, they reinterpreted the theory, much in line with standard Bohmian mechanics, to merely postulate the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and provide a definite ontology by asserting the existence of a particle undergoing the random motion determined by the wave function via the stochastic guiding law. In so doing they drop the postulate of a stochastic Newton\u2019s Second Law, and furthermore avoid the Wallstrom criticism (see footnote 3). In effect, they take a less ambitious perspective than Nelson did. In what follows, we adhere to the interpretation of Bohm and Hiley as a matter of simplicity, but continue to refer to it as Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics.\\n\\n2.2 Discrete Formulation\\n\\nThroughout this work, we will supplement the discussion by displaying results of numerical simulations of Nelson\u2019s theory.

Instead, they reinterpreted the theory, much in line with standard Bohmian mechanics, to merely postulate the Schr\u00a8odinger equation, and provide a definite ontology by asserting the existence of a particle undergoing the random motion determined by the wave function via the stochastic guiding law. In so doing they drop the postulate of a stochastic Newton\u2019s Second Law, and furthermore avoid the Wallstrom criticism (see footnote 3). In effect, they take a less ambitious perspective than Nelson did. In what follows, we adhere to the interpretation of Bohm and Hiley as a matter of simplicity, but continue to refer to it as Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics.  \\n\\n2.2 Discrete Formulation\\n\\nThroughout this work, we will supplement the discussion by displaying results of numerical simulations of Nelson\u2019s theory.

Two excitation lasers (PicoQuant LDH Series) were employed for the optical excitation: one laser with emission energy $h\\\\omega = 1.70$ eV and an optical power density of 2.29 kW/cm$^2$ to excite RTD-As, and another laser with energy $h\\\\omega = 1.15$ eV and an optical power density of 12.5 kW/cm$^2$, used to excite RTD-Sb. Both lasers were operated in continuous-wave and pulsed modes to characterize the emission spectra and the temporal evolution via photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectroscopies, respectively. During PL measurements, the optical responses of RTD-As and RTD-Sb observed at different bias voltages were dispersed by a 75 and 50 cm spectrometer (Andor Shamrock), respectively. Then, the signals were detected by a high-speed Si charge-coupled device (Andor iDus 420) and a high-resolution InGaAs diode array (Andor DU491A) for RTD-As and RTD-Sb, respectively. During time-resolved PL measurements, both lasers operated at a repetition rate of 80 MHz, with a pulse duration of around 100 ps, while the transient responses were detected by an infrared photomultiplier tube (PicoQuant Si PMT Hybrid and Hamamatsu InGaAs/InP H10330B-75, for RTD-As and RTD-Sb measurements, respectively) coupled to a time-correlated single-photon counting electronics (PicoQuant PicoHarp300).\\n\\nIII.

Quantities same as in Fig. 1.\\n\\nA protocol that implements the imaginary time evolution trajectory without any need for quantum tomography or ancilla resources. This hybrid algorithm involves a classical time integration to generate the adiabatic Hamiltonian. When implemented faithfully, the algorithm leads to an exponential decrease of the infidelity with the ground-state of a desired Hamiltonian with adiabatic time. However, the cost of evolving exactly to long imaginary times grows rapidly with imaginary time both in the classical and quantum parts of the protocol. The growth in cost as a function of imaginary time arises from several sources, including the nonlocality of the derived adiabatic Hamiltonian. This nonlocality can be controlled by suitable heuristics which truncate terms in the adiabatic Hamiltonian. Another source of growing cost at long imaginary time is related to the norm of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its gap, for which modifications of the generating equation of the adiabatic Hamiltonian can be introduced and which should be further explored. However, because of the rapid decrease of the infidelity it is possible to propagate for short times and to observe a large improvement in the approximate ground-state. More generally, the A-QITE adiabatic path introduced in this work can be considered as extending the space of possible adiabatic paths; this potentially allows for introduction of new quantum adiabatic routines consisting of composite adiabatic paths (with A-QITE as one of them), with applications such as introduction of novel adiabatic catalysts [8, 24], etc. This is a direction to be explored in the future.\\n\\nOverall, a significant advantage of the current approach is that it can be implemented with a minimal amount of quantum resources (i.e. no ancillae and no measurement-based feedback). This makes our procedure a good match for near-term quantum architectures.\\n\\nV.

(1), it is convenient to expand the wavefunction in basis functions that are compatible with the boundary conditions according to $\\\\psi(R, r) = \\\\sum_{q, k} \\\\sin(q_z Z) e^{i(q_x X + q_y Y)} e^{i k \\\\cdot r} \\\\psi_q(k)/\\\\sqrt{V}$. Here $q = (q_x, q_y, q_z)^T$ and $k = (k_x, k_y, k_z)^T$ denote the center-of-mass and relative wavevectors, respectively, and $V = L_x L_y L_z$ is the system volume. The wavevector $q_z$ has a different quantization condition arising from the different boundary condition. We have $q_z = \\\\pi n/L_z$ whereas $q_{x,y} = 2\\\\pi m_{x,y}/L_{x,y}$ and $k_{x,y,z} = 2\\\\pi l_{x,y,z}/L_{x,y,z}$, with $n = 1, 2, \\\\ldots$ and $m_{x,y,z}, l_{x,y,z} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$. In this basis, the Cooper problem reads\\n\\n$$\\\\left( \\\\xi_{k_+} + \\\\xi_{k_-} \\\\right) \\\\psi_q(k) - \\\\frac{1}{V} \\\\sum_{k'} V(k - k') \\\\psi_q(k') = E\\\\psi_q(k),$$\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere $k_{\\\\pm} = k \\\\pm q/2$, $\\\\xi_k = \\\\hbar^2 k^2/(2m) - \\\\mu$ is the single-particle energy dispersion, and $V(k) = \\\\int d^3 r e^{-i k \\\\cdot r} V(r)$ is the interaction matrix element. In He-3, the dominant angular momentum channel is $l = 1$, and we choose $V(k - k') = 4\\\\pi g \\\\sum_{m=-1}^1 Y_{1m}(k) Y_{1m}^*(k')$, where $g > 0$ is the coupling constant and $Y_{1m}(k) = Y_{1m}(\\\\theta_k, \\\\phi_k)$ is the spherical harmonic of degree $l$ and order $m$. The corresponding Hamiltonian is time-reversal symmetric and, importantly, conserves the center-of-mass momentum $q$. Generally, a large $q$ will increase the energy of the bound state. Thus, we take $q$ to be the smallest admissible wavevector $q = (0, 0, \\\\pi/L_z)$.

[274] that the probability of violation increases rapidly with the number of measurement settings per party. For the GHZ state, already for two parties and five settings, $P_V$ is close to 100%. This fact can be explained in two ways. Firstly, from a statistical point of view, as the number of settings increases, so does the chance of finding suitable pairs of settings. Secondly, new inequalities emerge involving all the additional measurement settings. Additionally, in Ref. [260] it is shown in general that for any pure bipartite entangled state, the probability of violation tends to unity when the number of measurement settings tends to infinity.\\n\\nMultiplicativity of probability of violation.\u2014The probability of violation is not additive, but rather multiplicative [274], in the sense that the probability $P_{BL} = 1 - P_V$ to choose settings allowing a Bell-local explanation is multiplicative over subsystems with\\n\\n$$P_{BL}(\\\\rho_1 \\\\otimes \\\\rho_2) = P_{BL}(\\\\rho_1) P_{BL}(\\\\rho_2).$$\\n\\nThis immediately hints at the increase of $P_V$ with system size. Consider for example a product of $n$ two-qubit GHZ states $\\\\text{GHZ}_2^{\\\\otimes n}$. Using the result $P_V(\\\\text{GHZ}_2) = 2(\\\\pi - 3)$ obtained above, the probability of violation becomes\\n\\n$$P_V(\\\\text{GHZ}_2^{\\\\otimes n}) = 1 - P_{BL}(\\\\text{GHZ}_2^{\\\\otimes n}) = 1 - (P_{BL}(\\\\text{GHZ}_2))^n = 1 - (7 - 2\\\\pi)^n,$$\\n\\nwhich converges to unity for large $n$.\\n\\nMaximal probability of violation.\u2014It was shown that the $n$-particle GHZ state maximises the probability of violation for a special set of two-outcome inequalities containing only full $n$-particle correlation functions when $n$ is even [260]. More generally, if we are not restricted to any particular type of inequality and consider the full set of possible two-setting Bell inequalities (in practice only realisable via the numerical method discussed in Sec. 5.3) it turns out that the GHZ states do not exhibit the highest $P_V$. Note that due to the numerical nature of the considerations, it is difficult to explicitly find the state which maximises $P_V$.\\n\\nMaximal non-locality and maximal entanglement.\u2014One commonly used measure of non-locality, namely the robustness to white noise, was already introduced in Eq. (5.2). However, it has many disadvantages. One flagship example is the discrepancy between the maximal violation of the two-setting $d$-outcome CGLMP inequality [277] and its violation by the $d \\\\times d$ maximally entangled state. It turns out that some asymmetric states tolerate a greater admixture of white noise while remaining non-local than the maximally entangled states. For the probability of violation, however, the value is maximised by the maximally entangled states and the anomaly disappears at least for $d \\\\leq 10$ [278]. In addition, it is proven in Ref. [260] that for two qubits in a pure state the probability of violation for bipartite full-correlation Bell inequalities is an entanglement monotone.\\n\\nWitness for genuine multipartite entanglement.\u2014The probability of violation can also serve as a witness of genuine multipartite entanglement [102]. For example, for $n = 3$ and two settings per party, $P_V > 2(\\\\pi - 3)$ certifies that the state is truly multipartite entangled [274]. For a larger number of particles and a larger number of settings, similar criteria can also be formulated. However, so far they are only based on numerics, see, e.g. Ref. [279].\\n\\nTypicality of non-locality.\u2014The notion of probability of violation also allows to address the question how typical non-locality is not only under variation of observables but also of states. In Ref. [274], it was shown that the typical $n$-qubit states present in many quantum information problems for $n \\\\geq 5$ exhibit Bell non-local correlations for almost any choice of observables ($P_V > 99.99\\\\%$). In Ref. [268], through a sampling of the whole state space of pure states it was demonstrated that for a random pure state the probability of violation strongly increases with the number of qubits and already for $N \\\\geq 6$ it is greater than 99.99\\\\%.\"}\n\n "], "olmocr": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"5.4.

One flagship example is the discrepancy between the maximal violation of the two-setting $d$-outcome CGLMP inequality [277] and its violation by the $d \\\\times d$ maximally entangled state. It turns out that some asymmetric states tolerate a greater admixture of white noise while remaining non-local than the maximally entangled states. For the probability of violation, however, the value is maximised by the maximally entangled states and the anomaly disappears at least for $d \\\\leq 10$ [278]. In addition, it is proven in Ref. [260] that for two qubits in a pure state the probability of violation for bipartite fullcorrelation Bell inequalities is an entanglement monotone. \\n\\nWitness for genuine multipartite entanglement.\u2014The probability of violation can also serve as a witness of genuine multipartite entanglement [102]. For example, for $n = 3$ and two settings per party, $P_V > 2(\\\\pi - 3)$ certifies that the state is truly multipartite entangled [274]. For a larger number of particles and a larger number of settings, similar criteria can also be formulated. However, so far they are only based on numerics, see, e.g. Ref. [279]. \\n\\nTypicality of non-locality.\u2014The notion of probability of violation also allows to address the question how typical non-locality is not only under variation of observables but also of states. In Ref. [274], it was shown that the typical $n$-qubit states present in many quantum information problems for $n \\\\geq 5$ exhibit Bell non-local correlations for almost any choice of observables ($P_V > 99.99\\\\%$). In Ref. [268], through a sampling of the whole state space of pure states it was demonstrated that for a random pure state the probability of violation strongly increases with the number of qubits and already for $N \\\\geq 6$ it is greater than 99.99\\\\%. \\n\\n38\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"V.

We therefore take the simplest model of our environment to be that of the single coupled qubit, as shown in Fig. 4.

The model utilizes autoregressive neural networks, specifically Transformers, to learn the joint probability of logical operators and syndromes. This training is in an unsupervised way, without the need for labeled training data, and is thus referred to as pre-training.

If it is not specified explicitly, all spectra are calculated for \\\\( x_0 = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nThe equations (46) and (47) provide the flux conservation at every frequency: \\\\( |\\\\gamma(\\\\omega)|^2 + |\\\\delta(\\\\omega)|^2 = |\\\\gamma_0(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\). However, this simple condition is not valid for exact equations (44) and (45) where the normalization condition has the form of integral quantity (9). For every plot in Fig.3-Fig.6 we calculated the normalizing quantity \\\\( I = \\\\int d\\\\omega |\\\\gamma_{WW}(\\\\omega)|^2 + \\\\int d\\\\omega |\\\\delta_{WW}(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\) where the integration was performed within the frequency span of the plots. In every case, \\\\( I \\\\) differs from unity less than a percent.\\n\\nThe major difference between the plots of equations (44), (45) and those of equations (46), (47) is that the transmittance \\\\( |\\\\gamma_{WW}(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\) never equals zero at the resonance frequency, \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\Omega \\\\) and the reflectance \\\\( |\\\\delta_{WW}(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\) never reaches its maximum value \\\\( |\\\\gamma_0(\\\\Omega)|^2 \\\\). These are the principal part integrals in (44), (45) which are responsible for these properties. From the other hand, the shape of the lines are similar. The transmittance \\\\( |\\\\gamma_{WW}(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\) is up shifted relative to \\\\( |\\\\gamma(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\), while the reflectance \\\\( |\\\\delta_{WW}(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\) is down shifted relative to \\\\( |\\\\gamma(\\\\omega)|^2 \\\\).\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"5.1 Hadamard Operation Example\\n\\nThe evolution of the Hadamard operation, \\\\( H = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), is given by \\\\( \\\\dot{H}_H = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) and \\\\( |\\\\varphi\\\\rangle \\\\) is one qubit, \\\\( z_0 |0\\\\rangle + z_1 |1\\\\rangle \\\\).
