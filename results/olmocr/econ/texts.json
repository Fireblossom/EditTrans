Frisch and Waugh ( 1933 ) only one random variable could be included in $W_2$ (the subset of covariates that was not of interest to the researcher).

In the context of OLS estimation, Lovell ( 1963 ) demonstrated two important results: (a) the coefficient vectors are numerically the same whether they are estimated from the multiple or the partial regressions, and (b) the vector of residuals from the multiple and partial regressions are numerically the same. 22 22 The first I omit the proofs because they are just special cases of theorem result completed the YFWL so far as the estimate of the coefficient is concerned because the partitioning of the set of regressors was completely general; the second result laid the groundwork for comparing estimated variances of the coefficient vectors from multiple and partial regressions. 23 5.4 23 It is straightforward to extend the YFWL from ordinary least squares to generalized least squares estimation, as Lovell had noted when commenting on autocorrelated errors ( Lovell, 1963 , p. 1004).

This force pushes the optimistic player to reduce information arrival in the first period, in order to decrease the (subjective) probability of a co-worker\u2019s change in mind. However, when the relation between effort and informativeness is inverse \u2013 as of point (ii) \u2013 the way to reduce information arrival is by working harder. Hence, even under these alternative assumptions, disagreement pushes optimists to work harder and, if negative externalities are strong enough, a disagreeing team will produce on average more than any like-minded team. 35 A few details of the propositions will indeed need to be intuitively modified for the result to hold under the assumptions of claim 1. In particular, the second part of proposition 3 (ii) holds for \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) negative enough; and the requirement for inequalities to be strict becomes that \\\\( \\\\varphi_{m^{-1}}(e, k|m') \\\\) is strictly decreasing in effort.\\n\\nWe conclude the discussion with a word on the welfare implications of disagreement. A welfare analysis would be particularly complex in our setup, which does not impose strong assumptions on the true process \\\\( Q \\\\). Without such assumptions, it is hard to tell, for instance, whether the effort levels that maximize team members\u2019 joint expected payoffs (or are Pareto efficient in terms of expected utility) are above or below \\\\( e^\\\\mathcal{H} \\\\) and \\\\( e^\\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). What we can say with certainty is that if the assumptions of proposition 5 part (i) hold and if, additionally, \\\\( Q_x = Q_y = \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\), any Pareto efficient stage effort must be above \\\\( e^\\\\mathcal{H} \\\\). Hence the boost in both players\u2019 effort generated by horizontal disagreement can \u2013 as in the example presented in section 1.1 \u2013 lead to a Pareto improvement. Not much can be concluded, however, in general.\\n\\nThis final observation leaves us with a word of caution: we have shown that disagreement can increase effort.

After a consumer arrives to the market, the firms who know the consumer\u2019s specific location simultaneously offer personalized prices. If firm $A$ offers a consumer a personalized price, this offer subsumes the firm\u2019s original uniform price. Thus, the uniform price $p_A$ will apply only to those consumers who will not subsequently be offered a personalized price by firm $A$.\\n\\nImportantly, when firms set personalized prices, they know the uniform price set by firm $A$ in the previous stage. This is the standard timing considered in the literature (see, e.g., [33, 10, 9, 26, 8]).\\\\footnote{An alternative model that we do not analyze is one in which firms set uniform and personalized prices simultaneously, for each consumer. [26] show that, in this case, a (pure) equilibrium may fail to exist.}\\n\\nFor any fixed mechanism $M$, we will consider the pure subgame perfect equilibria of the game that starts with data-sharing mechanism $M$. Such equilibria always exists, and consist of a uniform price for firm $A$ followed by personalized prices for both firms. Once the uniform price is fixed, the equilibrium personalized prices for each consumer $\\\\theta$ are uniquely fixed. We will be interested in designing mechanisms $M$ that lead to equilibria with high firm-profits and high consumer-welfare.\\n\\nOne important desideratum of data-sharing mechanisms (with corresponding equilibria) is that they be individually rational (IR): That the expected utility of each firm with data sharing be at least as high as without data sharing. A data-sharing mechanism should be IR if we expect firms to participate.\\n\\nOur main focus will be on mechanisms that are not only IR, but also Pareto-improving: when sharing takes place, (i) the expected utility of each firm and every consumer be at least as high as without data sharing, and that (ii) either firm $A$\u2019s profits, firm $B$\u2019s profits, or total consumer welfare be strictly higher.\\n\\nWe note that many of our results make no assumptions about the distribution of consumers. In such a general setting there may be multiple equilibria, even with no data-sharing, each with different uniform prices. Hence, we will often describe mechanisms as being IR or Pareto-improving relative to a particular no-sharing equilibrium.\\n\\n## 3 No Data-Sharing\\n\\nWe begin by analyzing equilibria under no data-sharing. To this end, define $\\\\mu(p_A) = \\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{p_A}{2}$. If firm $A$ charges uniform price $p_A$, then the consumer located at $\\\\mu(p_A)$ is indifferent between purchasing from firm $A$ at that price and purchasing from firm $B$ at price 0.

Thus, the uniform price $p_A$ will apply only to those consumers who will not subsequently be offered a personalized price by firm $A$.\\n\\nImportantly, when firms set personalized prices, they know the uniform price set by firm $A$ in the previous stage.

Such equilibria always exists, and consist of a uniform price for firm $A$ followed by personalized prices for both firms. Once the uniform price is fixed, the equilibrium personalized prices for each consumer $\\\\theta$ are uniquely fixed. We will be interested in designing mechanisms $M$ that lead to equilibria with high firm-profits and high consumer-welfare. \\n\\nOne important desideratum of data-sharing mechanisms (with corresponding equilibria) is that they be individually rational (IR): That the expected utility of each firm with data sharing be at least as high as without data sharing. A data-sharing mechanism should be IR if we expect firms to participate. \\n\\nOur main focus will be on mechanisms that are not only IR, but also Pareto-improving: when sharing takes place, (i) the expected utility of each firm and every consumer be at least as high as without data sharing, and that (ii) either firm $A$\u2019s profits, or total consumer welfare be strictly higher. \\n\\nWe note that many of our results make no assumptions about the distribution of consumers. In such a general setting there may be multiple equilibria, even with no data-sharing, each with different uniform prices. Hence, we will often describe mechanisms as being IR or Pareto-improving relative to a particular no-sharing equilibrium. \\n\\n\\\\footnote{An alternative model that we do not analyze is one in which firms set uniform and personalized prices simultaneously, for each consumer.

Changing $\\\\lambda$ scales the noncooperative game and the first-best solution identically and hence also has no impact on efficiency. \\n\\nMore notably, the efficiency condition is independent of $R_w$ and $\\\\pi_w$; that is, the condition for efficiency does not depend on what the winner receives. To understand this, consider an incremental increase in $R_w$ or $\\\\pi_w$, fixing $R_l$ and $\\\\pi_l$. Any incremental increase induces agents in the noncooperative game to experiment more but also induces more experimentation in the social planner problem. To understand why this does not affect the efficiency implications, consider the best-response problem of agent $i$. For agent $i$, the cumulative effort of other agents $K_{-i}$ brings about a \u201closs\u201d event at a rate of $\\\\lambda K_{-i}$, but agent $i$ has no agency over the effort of the other agents. Instead, the effort choice for agent $i$ weighs the relative benefit of winning versus the status quo project (and in fact, $b_I$ and $c_I$ have no $R_l, \\\\pi_l$ dependence).

A branch of research emphasizing on the disruptive labor market impacts of LLMs is emerging quickly, however, it predominantly focuses attention on the labor market in developed economy, in particularly U.S. (Eloundou et al. 2023; Peng et al. 2023; Noy and Zhang 2023; Brynjolfsson, Li, and Raymond 2023; Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2023).

The results show a great heterogeneous exposure across occupations and suggest that more educated, relatively high-paid, white-collar occupations may be most exposed to LLMs. In addition to the positive correlation between wage, education and occupational exposure, we also find a positive correlation between experience premium and exposure to LLMs, implying a potential diminishing return of learning by doing in the future. We analyze exposure by industry and discover that the education and healthcare industries exhibit high ex- posure, while manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction demonstrate lower exposure. Unlike other developed countries, that young and old cohort distribute highly unevenly across industries in China demonstrate a great variance of demographic exposure of LLMs. Relatively LLMs inevitably exert a higher impact on young age employers. Our analysis also indicates that LLMs will have a greater impact on labor demand. We utilize an online job postings dataset from January 2017 to December 2022 in China to construct an occupational vacancies index. We find a pos- itive correlation between the share of vacancies and exposure score at occupation level. This implies that the labor demand structure is likely to exacerbate the disruptive im-\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"Our rate explicitly accommodates for function classes of increasing complexity.

These results match the empirical results of Gruber and Vigfusson ( 2018 ) who show that higher interest rates imply higher price volatility. \\n\\nFigure 6: Contemporaneous IRFs (in percentage points) to a 25 bp interest rate shock for various parameters and realized states\"}\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"[11] Hana Choi, Carl F Mela, Santiago R Balseiro, and Adam Leary.

Since there are various types of reserves in general insurance, in this section we provide the overall idea of the methodology for the total reserve of outstanding claims only. Section 3 will delve into the specific details of the methodology for the most prevalent and significant reserves in general insurance, namely RBNS and IBNR reserves.\\n\\n2.1 The claim reserving problem\\n\\nSuppose an insurance company is analyzing its total liabilities associated with claims whose accident times occur between \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) is the valuation time of analysis as defined by the actuary. In general insurance, accidents are often not immediately reported to the insurance company for various reasons, resulting in a significant delay between the occurrence of a claimable accident and the time the insurance company is notified. Therefore, at a given valuation time \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\), the insurance company only has information on the claims reported by \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) and is unaware of the unreported claims. Furthermore, the complexity of the problem increases due to another delay in the payment process.

Since there are various types of reserves in general insurance, in this section we provide the overall idea of the methodology for the total reserve of outstanding claims only. Section 3 will delve into the specific details of the methodology for the most prevalent and significant reserves in general insurance, namely RBNS and IBNR reserves. \\n\\n2.1 The claim reserving problem\\n\\nSuppose an insurance company is analyzing its total liabilities associated with claims whose accident times occur between \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) is the valuation time of analysis as defined by the actuary. In general insurance, accidents are often not immediately reported to the insurance company for various reasons, resulting in a significant delay between the occurrence of a claimable accident and the time the insurance company is notified. Therefore, at a given valuation time \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\), the insurance company only has information on the claims reported by \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) and is unaware of the unreported claims. Furthermore, the complexity of the problem increases due to another delay in the payment process. When a claim is reported, it is common for it to be paid in several subpayments over time rather than as a lump sum. This is because the impact of an accident can evolve, requiring additional payments until it is fully settled. Therefore, at a given valuation time \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\), the insurance company is only aware of the claims that were reported on time, and for each one, it may have paid only a partial amount of the associated claim size, rather than the entire amount. \\n\\nAs a result, the insurance company is interested in estimating the total claim amount of these unreported claims, as well as the remaining payments of the reported claims, to construct the overall reserve of outstanding claims. This reserve is also known in the insurance jargon as the Incurred But Not Settled (IBNS), and it\u2019s usually decomposed into further subcomponents depending on whether the payment is associated with a reported or not reported claim. For simplicity, here we consider the estimation of the overall reserve of outstanding claims without referring to the components. \\n\\nThat said, let\u2019s describe the payment process as follows: \\n\\n- Let \\\\( N(\\\\tau) \\\\) represent the total number of different payments associated with all the claims whose accident time is before the valuation time \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\). \\n- Let \\\\( Y_i, i = 1, \\\\ldots, N(\\\\tau) \\\\) denote the sequence payments. Note that some payments may belong to the same claim/accident, but we will not make any distinction. \\n- Let \\\\( T_i, i = 1, \\\\ldots, N(\\\\tau) \\\\) denote the sequence of accident times associated with the claim underlying each payment; let \\\\( R_i, i = 1, \\\\ldots, N(\\\\tau) \\\\) denote the sequence of the associated reporting times; let \\\\( S_i, i = 1, \\\\ldots, N(\\\\tau) \\\\) denote the sequence of the associated times in which the payments take place. Clearly, \\\\( T_i < R_i < S_i \\\\) and note that the values \\\\( T_i, R_i \\\\) would be the same for payments associated with the same claim, but the \\\\( S_i \\\\) would differ. \\n- Let \\\\( U_i = R_i - T_i, i = 1, \\\\ldots, N(\\\\tau) \\\\) be the sequence of the reporting delay times associated with the claim underlying each payment, and \\\\( V_i = S_i - R_i, i = 1, \\\\ldots, N(\\\\tau) \\\\) be the sequence of the associated payment delay time of each payment.

If the entity fails to do so, depositors may lose confidence in the system, triggering a bank run. In contrast, systems with decentral managed collateral, and endogenous/decentrally managed collateral, we observe consistent results across the five sensitivity factors. The primary difference we observed was in the initial deviations of the price, which were smaller or larger depending on the sensitivity factor. However, crucially, the price and demand of these types were able to recover over time. For stablecoin types with endogenous/centrally managed collateral, we observe similar results for positive demand shocks. However, for negative demand shocks, we observed that this type only experiences a crash if the magnitude of the demand shock is sufficiently large; i.e., for sensitivity factors of 0.5 and 0.75, this type was able to recover without crashing 36 . Conversely, for sensitivity factors of 1.25 and 1.5, we observed a crash, which intuitively occurred more rapidly with a higher magnitude of the demand shock. \\n\\n- [2] Volatility of demand: Across all stablecoin types, we consistently observe the same outcomes across the five sensitivity factors. While there is increased volatility in both demand and price, the overall findings and conclusions remain unchanged. \\n\\n- [3] Fees: For stablecoin types with exogenous/centrally managed collateral, variations in fees did not have a significant effect on either the demand or the price. However, for stablecoin types with exogenous/decentrally managed collateral or endogenous/decentrally managed collateral, adjusting the fees led to changes in both the demand and subsequent price. Additionally, for stablecoin types with endogenous/centrally managed collateral, changes in fees can even result in a crash, independent of any external shocks. \\n\\n- [4] Price of collateral: For stablecoin types with exogenous/decentrally managed collateral, endogenous/decentrally managed collateral, and endogenous/centrally managed collateral, we observe a strong dependence of the stablecoin price on the price of the collateral. In our simulation, stablecoin types with exogenous/centrally managed collateral are directly backed by fiat money, which restricts our ability to analyze shocks in the collateral\u2019s price. This limitation arises because fiat money serves as both the collateral and the reference currency in the model. However, if we were to adjust the model similarly to the other stablecoin types, we would expect to obtain comparable results. \\n\\nThese sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our results, emphasizing the instability of endogenous/centrally managed stablecoins and the significance of collateral and fees in stablecoin dynamics. \\n\\n4.3.

When \\\\(|N|\\\\) is odd (meaning the majority rule is resolute), May (May 1952) shows that we can characterise the majority rule as the unique rule satisfying anonymity, neutrality and weak monotonicity. \\n\\nWe can use the proxy vote analogues of these properties to achieve the same characterisation result. The key point is that setting \\\\(|A| = 2\\\\) fully specifies the proxy mechanism \\\\(g\\\\), by the definition of a proxy mechanism (since either a voter submits an empty order, meaning she is allowed to delegate to any other voter, or she submits a linear order, meaning she casts her vote directly). In effect, we are close to a classical vote; the only voters who delegate their votes are the voters who submit empty orders. So it is unsurprising that the following result holds irrespective of the choice of \\\\(g\\\\).\\n\\n**Theorem 2** Suppose \\\\(|A| = 2\\\\) and \\\\(|N|\\\\) is odd.

Consider a program $j$ with cutoff $c_j$. Suppose, (consistently with the general finding of the empirical literature on college choice), that students tend to prefer programs of higher quality. If applicants behave strategically, one would expect applications to program $j$ to peak among students with application score close to $c_j$. If cutoffs tend to remain in the same neighborhood across years, students with application scores much higher than $c_j$ can expect to be admissible to more selective, higher-quality programs than $j$, which they prefer over $j$. Hence, we expect very few of these students to include $j$ in their list. As application scores get lower and closer to $c_j$, students\u2019 admission chances to the most selective programs decrease, and program $j$ becomes one of the most selective (desirable) program among those they still have a high admission probability. Hence, we expect applications to $c_j$ to increase as application scores decrease and get closer to $c_j$. As application scores decrease below $c_j$, students realize that their admission probability to program $j$ gets lower, and while program $j$ remains a relatively desirable (selective) alternative, we expect these expectations to drive applications down. This application pattern, expected if students behave strategically, is exactly what we observe on the top panel of Figure 1. Pooling all programs $j$ together, the top panel of Figure 1 shows the fraction of students listing program $j$ in their rank-order lists (ROL or $P$ in terms of our notation), as a function of the distance between their application for program $j$ and the cutoff $c_j$.\\n\\nIt may be difficult to disentangle the role of preferences from the role of expectations about admission probabilities when both may enter students\u2019 choice of which programs to include in their ROLs (Manski (2004); Agarwal and Somaini (2018)). The pattern observed in the top panel of Figure 1 could, alternatively, be consistent with students not behaving strategically but preferring programs that \u201care a good fit in terms of quality\u201d, that is, programs in which their skill level would be close to the average skill level. If that is the case, applications should peak among students whose skills (proxied by application score) are close to the mean skill level in the program. This is not what we observe in the bottom panel of Figure 1. Pooling all programs $j$ together, the bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the fraction of students including program $j$ in their list, as a function of the distance between their application for program $j$ and the mean application score among students admitted to $j$. Conditional on application score, the share of students applying to a program $j$ is not the highest for application scores close to the mean score among students admitted to $j$. It reaches its highest point well below this level, showing that students do not systematically prefer programs in which they would be the \u201caverage\u201d student.

Consider a program $j$ with cutoff $c_j$. Suppose, (consistently with the general finding of the empirical literature on college choice), that students tend to prefer programs of higher quality. If applicants behave strategically, one would expect applications to program $j$ to peak among students with application score close to $c_j$. If cutoffs tend to remain in the same neighborhood across years, students with application scores much higher than $c_j$ can expect to be admissible to more selective, higher-quality programs than $j$, which they prefer over $j$. Hence, we expect very few of these students to include $j$ in their list. As application scores get lower and closer to $c_j$, students\u2019 admission chances to the most selective programs decrease, and program $j$ becomes one of the most selective (desirable) program among those they still have a high admission probability. Hence, we expect applications to $c_j$ to increase as application scores decrease and get closer to $c_j$. As application scores decrease below $c_j$, students realize that their admission probability to program $j$ gets lower, and while program $j$ remains a relatively desirable (selective) alternative, we expect these expectations to drive applications down. This application pattern, expected if students behave strategically, is exactly what we observe on the top panel of Figure 1. Pooling all programs $j$ together, the top panel of Figure 1 shows the fraction of students listing program $j$ in their rank-order lists (ROL or $P$ in terms of our notation), as a function of the distance between their application for program $j$ and the cutoff $c_j$.\\n\\nIt may be difficult to disentangle the role of preferences from the role of expectations about admission probabilities when both may enter students\u2019 choice of which programs to include in their ROLs (Manski (2004); Agarwal and Somaini (2018)). The pattern observed in the top panel of Figure 1 could, alternatively, be consistent with students not behaving strategically but preferring programs that \u201care a good fit in terms of quality\u201d, that is, programs in which their skill level would be close to the average skill level. If that is the case, applications should peak among students whose skills (proxied by application score) are close to the mean skill level in the program. This is not what we observe in the bottom panel of Figure 1. Pooling all programs $j$ together, the bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the fraction of students including program $j$ in their list, as a function of the distance between their application for program $j$ and the mean application score among students admitted to $j$. Conditional on application score, the share of students applying to a program $j$ is not the highest for application scores close to the mean score among students admitted to $j$. It reaches its highest point well below this level, showing that students do not systematically prefer programs in which they would be the \u201caverage\u201d student. This further confirms the hypothesis that students behave strategically. \\n\\n5.2 Results\\n\\nRegardless of strategic behavior, the aggregation of treatment effects across different programs brings additional challenges not tackled in this paper; therefore, to more clearly illustrate the importance of accounting for strategic behavior, we focus on a single program.

Given an instance $\\\\varphi$ of PM-3SAT, our reduction constructs a 2-dimensional Euclidean election.

The rectangles for the variables are drawn along the $x$-axis, while the rectangles for the positive (resp., negative) clauses lie above (resp., below) the $x$-axis.

The latter can be considered almost fare-free public transport. The selected months were June, July, and August, i.e., a period characterized by summer holidays. Given the critical role of travel costs in mode choice (1), this natural experiment was expected to lead to a modal shift to public transport because the season ticket price cut was so substantial. In addition, many expected that the almost fare-free aspect of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d leads to high levels of induced demand. The success of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d prompted an immediate discussion as well as public and political demand for introducing a successor ticket to the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d as soon as possible. This ticket, the so-called \u201cDeutschlandticket\u201d, was finally introduced in May 2023. We set up the \u201cMobilit\u00e4t.Leben\u201d study to observe this fare policy innovation using questionnaires and GPS tracking to generate travel diaries (2, 3).\\n\\nThis behavioral intervention, which could be one of the largest public transport pricing travel behavior experiments, has been studied by many: all of them reported a substantial increase in public transport usage during the validity period of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d and a return to almost pre-ticket levels after the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d validity period (2, 4\u20137). The official and main study was conducted by Association of German Transport Companies, which surveyed more than 200,000 people in Germany (4): around 20% of all \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d customers were new customers to public transport. Out of all public transport trips in the months of June, July, and August 2022, 17% of trips have been shifted from other transport modes, and 10% of trips have been shifted from the car to public transport, in rural areas, even 13 to 16%. 16% of all trips correspond to induced demand. In addition, trip distances increased by 38% during the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d period. Another survey showed that 11% of all trips conducted during the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d period shifted from other modes of transport, while 6% of all trips were induced (6).

The latter can be considered almost fare-free public transport. The selected months were June, July, and August, i.e., a period characterized by summer holidays. Given the critical role of travel costs in mode choice ( 1 ), this natural experiment was expected to lead to a modal shift to public transport because the season ticket price cut was so substantial. In addition, many expected that the almost fare-free aspect of the \u201c9-EuroTicket\u201d leads to high levels of induced demand. The success of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d prompted an immediate discussion as well as public and political demand for introducing a successor ticket to the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d as soon as possible. This ticket, the so-called \u201cDeutschlandticket\u201d, was finally introduced in May 2023. We set up the \u201cMobilit\u00e4t.Leben\u201d study to observe this fare policy innovation using questionnaires and GPS tracking to generate travel diaries ( 2 , 3 ).\\n\\nThis behavioral intervention, which could be one of the largest public transport pricing travel behavior experiments, has been studied by many: all of them reported a substantial increase in public transport usage during the validity period of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d and a return to almost pre-ticket levels after the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d validity period ( 2 , 4 \u2013 7 ). The official and main study was conducted by Association of German Transport Companies, which surveyed more than 200,000 people in Germany ( 4 ): around 20% of all \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d customers were new customers to public transport. Out of all public transport trips in the months of June, July, and August 2022, 17% of trips have been shifted from other transport modes, and 10% of trips have been shifted from the car to public transport, in rural areas, even 13 to 16%. 16% of all trips correspond to induced demand. In addition, trip distances increased by 38% during the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d period. Another survey showed that 11% of all trips conducted during the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d period shifted from other modes of transport, while 6% of all trips were induced ( 6 ). Using surveys and GPS tracking, another study concluded that the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d did not lead to a change in daily mobility but instead increased leisure travel at the beginning and the end of the ticket\u2019s validity period, leaving monetary savings as the main effect of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d ( 5 ).
