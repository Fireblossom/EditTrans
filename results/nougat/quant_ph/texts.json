Therefore, the quantum source node can transmit information to the quantum destination node using entangled pairs. When the source node and the destination node are distant from each other, remote entanglement connections are established according to the assigned routing. Intermediate quantum nodes, known as quantum repeaters, connect source and destination nodes using entanglement swapping, which involves joint Bell state measurements, to create a remote entanglement connection [6]. Therefore, a critical challenge for constructing quantum networks at a large scale is the efficient utilization of entangled pairs and the identification of optimal routing strategies for managing massive entanglement connections.\n\nMeanwhile, maintaining Entanglement fidelity is crucial to ensure high-quality remote entanglement connections, as the noise in the system [8] may prevent quantum repeaters from producing entangled pairs with the desired fidelity. Low-fidelity entangled pairs can adversely impact the quality of services offered by quantum applications [10]. For example, when the fidelity of entangled pairs falls below the quantum bit error rate (BER) in quantum cryptographic protocols, it can lead to the degradation of the security of key distribution [11]. Fortunately, the entanglement purification techniques [12, 13, 14] can improve the fidelity of entangled pairs by using additional entangled pairs. These techniques utilize multiple entangled pairs to combine them in various ways to increase the fidelity of the final purified entangled pair, such as entanglement distillation, quantum error correction, and decoherence-free subspaces. However, determining the optimal number of additional entangled pairs required by the entanglement purification technique to meet the uncertain requirements of fidelity values needed by quantum applications is challenging and has been overlooked in the literature.\n\nTo overcome the challenges discussed above, in this paper, we propose an entangled pair and qubit resource management model in QCC. We focus on entangled pair resource allocation and fidelity-guaranteed entanglement routing in quantum networks, together with qubit resource allocation for quantum applications on quantum computers of the QCC providers. Specifically, we formulate the two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the optimal number of entangled pairs and the optimal number of qubits that can fulfill all requests from multiple quantum source nodes (i.e., users) and quantum destination nodes (i.e., providers). In the optimization problem, the uncertainties of fidelity requirements, the number of qubits, and the waiting time for quantum applications are taken into consideration. In addition, we apply the Benders decomposition algorithm to reduce both the complexity and execution time of the problem. The goal of the proposed model is to make optimal decisions for quantum applications in minimizing "], "nougat": ["encoded as qubits. Therefore, the quantum source node can transmit information to the quantum destination node using entangled pairs. When the source node and the destination node are distant from each other, remote entanglement connections are established according to the assigned routing. Intermediate quantum nodes, known as quantum repeaters, connect source and destination nodes using entanglement swapping, which involves joint Bell state measurements, to create a remote entanglement connection [6]. Therefore, a critical challenge for constructing quantum networks at a large scale is the efficient utilization of entangled pairs and the identification of optimal routing strategies for managing massive entanglement connections.\n\nMeanwhile, maintaining Entanglement fidelity is crucial to ensure high-quality remote entanglement connections, as the noise in the system [8] may prevent quantum repeaters from producing entangled pairs with the desired fidelity. Low-fidelity entangled pairs can adversely impact the quality of services offered by quantum applications [10]. For example, when the fidelity of entangled pairs falls below the quantum bit error rate (BER) in quantum cryptographic protocols, it can lead to the degradation of the security of key distribution [11]. Fortunately, the entanglement purification techniques [12]\u2013[14] can improve the fidelity of entangled pairs by using additional entangled pairs. These techniques utilize multiple entangled pairs to combine them in various ways to increase the fidelity of the final purified entangled pair, such as entanglement distillation, quantum error correction, and decoherence-free subspaces.

Beyond quantum computation, our encoded GHZ-state measurements may also find use in quantum communication (see App. B.2 for further discussion). For instance, they may be used to perform multipath routing, which can enhance entanglement rates in quantum networks [49; 50].\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Ian Walmsley, Josh Nunn, Alex Jones, Richard Tatham and our colleagues at ORCA computing for their helpful comments.\n\n## References\n\n* (1) A.

To date, applications have mostly been limited to linear systems and it has rarely been investigated or demonstrated in the nonlinear regime. In addition, the \"black box\" nature of inverse design techniques has hindered the understanding of optimized inverse-designed structures. We propose an inverse design method with interpretable results to enhance the efficiency of on-chip photon generation rate through nonlinear processes by controlling the effective phase-matching conditions. We fabricate and characterize a compact, inverse-designed device using a silicon-on-insulator platform that allows a spontaneous four-wave mixing process to generate photon pairs at 1.1MHz with a coincidence to accidental ratio of 162. Our design method accounts for fabrication constraints and can be used for scalable quantum light sources in large-scale communication and computing applications.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nEnhancing nonlinear optical processes has been a long-standing challenge due to materials' weak nonlinear response. The quest for effective approaches to achieve on-chip frequency conversion and generate photon pairs has been an enduring endeavor. Over the last decades, various nanophotonic platforms have been proposed to implement and enhance nonlinear photon generation processes, including wire waveguides,, nanobeam cavities,, metamaterials,, microring resonators,, periodically poled waveguides/cavities,, and photonic crystal cavities..

To date, applications have mostly been limited to linear systems and it has rarely been investigated or demonstrated in the nonlinear regime. In addition, the \"black box\" nature of inverse design techniques has hindered the understanding of optimized inverse-designed structures. We propose an inverse design method with interpretable results to enhance the efficiency of on-chip photon generation rate through nonlinear processes by controlling the effective phase-matching conditions. We fabricate and characterize a compact, inverse-designed device using a silicon-on-insulator platform that allows a spontaneous four-wave mixing process to generate photon pairs at 1.1MHz with a coincidence to accidental ratio of 162. Our design method accounts for fabrication constraints and can be used for scalable quantum light sources in large-scale communication and computing applications.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nEnhancing nonlinear optical processes has been a longstanding challenge due to materials\u2019 weak nonlinear response. The quest for effective approaches to achieve on-chip frequency conversion and generate photon pairs has been an enduring endeavor. Over the last decades, various nanophotonic platforms have been proposed to implement and enhance nonlinear photon generation processes, including wire waveguides,, nanobeam cavities,, metamaterials,, microring resonators,, periodically poled waveguides/cavities,, and photonic crystal cavities.. It is well-known that high-quality factor cavities designed at target frequencies can bolster the nonlinear process by enhancing the field with confinement. Yet, the effective phase matching conditions are typically challenging to satisfy in non-conventional cavity structures. Without effective phase-matching, the generated photons from different positions in nonlinear materials can destructively interfere, reducing the total generation efficiency. Such issues can be addressed by computational inverse design.. Recently, the adjoint method has been generalized to optimize nonlinear photonic processes, such as second harmonic generation or optical switches based on the Kerr effect.. However, current optimization methods face difficulties in generalization to multi-photon generation processes, and the coupling efficiencies for both input and output channels are often overlooked due to the optimization complexity. In addition, an intuitive understanding of the inverse-designed structure is unclear. The optimized structure often lacks interpretability, making it challenging to gain insights into how and why the in-verse design method works.\n\nTo address these challenges, we put forth an inverse design approach to amplify the efficiency of on-chip photon pair generation. We implement this strategy using the open-source package EmOpt.. Our method employs a multi-frequency co-optimization strategy and calculates gradients with respect to the design parameters via the adjoint method. The resulting efficiency enhancement stems not only from the increased field intensity due to the confinement of light in high quality factor cavity resonances but also from the improvement of phase-matching conditions, along with coupling between the cavity and waveguide mode considered in the design. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by fabricating and characterizing an optimized device that enables the efficient generation of photon pairs. Interestingly, the shape of the proposed design can also be explained by an effective potential method, and the approximate solution aligns well with the finite-difference frequency domain (FDFD) simulation results. The proposed optimization strategy can be generalized to other nonlinear processes for compact frequency-mixing devices on-chip, and the performance can be further improved using global optimization methods..\n\n## II Method and Proposed Device\n\nThe proposed multi-frequency co-optimization method exemplifies the spontaneous four-wave"]}, {"edit": ["suring the system and hence disturbing it.

Here \\(\\Delta s_{k}\\) is the entropy change in the environment associated to the \\(k\\)th jump [ 57 ].\n\nWe further assume the system of interest to be initially prepared at time \\(t=0\\) in a pure state \\(\\ket{n}_{0}\\) with probability \\(p_{n}(0)\\), as sampled from \\(\\rho_{0}=\\sum_{n}p_{n}(0)\\ket{n}\\bra{n}_{0}\\). Moreover, we introduce a final projective measurement at time \\(\\tau\\) on the system using an arbitrary set of rank-1 projectors \\(\\{\\ket{m}\\bra{m}_{\\tau}\\}\\), that is useful for the thermodynamic description at the level of fluctuations [ 25 ].\n\nThe dynamics described by the master equation ( 4 ) can be _unravelled_ into quantum trajectories by introducing a continuous monitoring scheme [ 2 ], where a generalized measurement is performed on the system at every infinitesimal instant of time \\(dt\\), such that \\(\\rho_{t+dt}=\\sum_{k}M_{k}\\rho_{t}M_{k}^{\\dagger}\\) with measurement operators verifying \\(\\sum_{k}M_{k}^{\\dagger}M_{k}=\\openone\\). For concreteness, we assume in the following a quantum jump unravelling, although the results derived here are generically valid for other schemes. Within this approach, the system evolution can be described by a sequence of smooth evolution periods intersected by abrupt _jumps_ associated with operators \\(L_{k}\\), occurring at stochastic times. More precisely, we have \\(M_{k}=\\sqrt{dt}L_{k}\\) with \\(k=1...K\\), for a detection of a jump of type \\(k\\) in the interval \\([t,t+dt]\\), and \\(M_{0}=\\openone-iHdt-dt\\sum_{k}L_{k}^{\\dagger}L_{k}/2\\), for no-jumps during \\(dt\\).\n\nThe above procedure is known to describe the state of the system conditioned on a given record of jumps detected during the evolution as a pure state \\(\\ket{\\psi}_{t}\\), following a "]}, {"edit": ["The three complex coupling coefficients, \\(g_{1}=\\left|g_{1}\\right|e^{i\\phi_{1}}\\), \\(g_{2}=\\left|g_{2}\\right|e^{i\\phi_{2}}\\), and \\(\\mu=\\left|\\mu\\right|e^{i\\phi_{\\mu}}\\), in Eq.

Depending on the dimension of coding, it can be divided into discretevariable QKD (DV-QKD) and continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) [ 4 , 5 ]. Between them, CV-QKD uses coherent detection technology to replace single-photon detection technology, which can be well compatible with classical optical communication systems [ 6 ]. In addition, the transmission distance achieved recently can support the requirement in metropolitan distances [ 7 \u2013 9 ] which facilitates the large-scale application of QKD [ 107 , 28 ] and lower complexity of classical error correction [ 29 , 30 ], the unconditional security of DM CVQKD protocols (e.g.two-state and three-state protocols [ 31 , 32 ]) has been successively proved. Recently, one of its security analysis theory is using the semidefinite program (SDP) model to give the lower bound of the secret key rate [ 33 \u2013 37 ], and related experiments have also been carried out [ 9 , 29 , 38 ]. With the tremendous progress in theory and experiment of DM CV-QKD in recent years, its practical system security has received increasing attention. Different from theoretical analysis, the transmission of the local oscillator in the practical DM CV-QKD system would leave Eve with vulnerabilities to perform quantum hacking.\n\nThe local oscillator (LO) is required for stable coherent detection, whose non-ideality within practical environments is usually ignored in the security analysis of CV-QKD. Due to the imperfection of practical blocks and devices, researchers have proposed many quantum hacking models aiming at practical LO, such as local oscillator calibration attack [39 ], local oscillator intensity fluctuation attack [40 ], wavelength attacks [ 41 , 42 ], polarization attack [43 ] and so on. Particularly, the transmission of LO opens a security vulnerability which gives eavesdropper (Eve) advantages to exploit the fluctuation of LO intensity [44 ]. We note that in the previous studies [ 40 ], Eve is assumed to reduce the intensity of LO overall using variable attenuators which can easily be defended by commonly-used monitoring technology such as monitoring the LO intensity mean and optical power or monitoring the shot-noise. In other words, the above manipulation and monitoring of LO intensity is carried out on its overall mean. When Eve simulates random fluctuations in LO intensity with invariant mean value, a more serious security loophole appears because above mentioned monitoring techniques will fail.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a modified local oscillator intensity attack (LOIA) with random fluctuations.

We compute iterates of the oracle function (the orbits) for different values of initial condition \\(x_{0}\\) and control variable \\(\\mu\\). All orbits eventually enter a periodic cycle. The index of the iteration where the cycle is entered we call \\(k_{c}\\).

In other words we chose \\(\\mu\\) so that \\(2^{n}\\mu\\) is an integer.\n\nIn Figure 2 we show the result of iterating the oracle with oracle function generated by truncating the logistic map. In Figure 2a we show iterates 20 through 40 for \\(n=6\\) qubits (and \\(N=2^{n}=64\\) states). For both panels, the initial condition \\(x_{0}=2^{n-1}\\).

For \\(\\mu<1\\) all orbits approach \\(x=0\\). For \\(1<\\mu<3\\) there is a single attracting fixed point. At \\(\\mu=3\\) there is a bifurcation giving an attracting period 2 orbit for \\(3.0<\\mu\\lesssim 3.45\\). Subsequent bifurcations show the phenomenon known as _period doubling_.

For each value of \\(\\mu\\), the iterates are close together but cycle between nearby values. When an orbit is periodic, we refer to it as a cycle. Maps can have computationally determined periods that are dependent on the precision of the arithmetic [9, 16].

Using a simple setup consisting of only three optical elements placed along a single beam line, we are able to generate highly complex pulses of light for which any given wavelength (or transverse angular position) the light field shows a different spatial (or spectral) polarization pattern. We further show that all three DoF's are non-separable and the complex vectorial nature of the light field can only be observed when all DoF's are resolved.

This decoder is based on the analogy between the decoding problem of the color code and the Light-sOut puzzle when the error model in consideration is the bit-flip noise. The LightsOut puzzle refers to a problem where a lattice whose faces are associated with switches and lights can be either on or off. In such lattice, toggling a switch on the lattice implies that all its neighbouring lights change their previous state, i.e. if they were on they are turned of and vice versa.

However, this reduction in code distance naturally reduces the physical distance between holes, and this tradeoff is investigated below.\n\n### _Software strategies_\n\nOnce the hardware requirements are met, the next step is software. As mentioned earlier, the idea is to move the logical qubit far enough to prevent the CRE from destroying it. In this paper, as in our previous work [18], we only consider errors caused by cosmic rays. We assume that the code distance has been set to suppress logical state errors due to ordinary decoherence thoroughly enough that we can ignore them.\n\nWe must be able to detect a cosmic ray strike as quickly as possible. While the details of such a determination remain to be determined, we can describe the general outline. As noted earlier, CREs preferentially result in \\(|1\\rangle\\rightarrow|0\\rangle\\) decay. If all of the qubits in a Z stabilizer decohere simultaneously, the syndrome qubit will still be measured as 0, indicating no error. However, the X stabilizer will result in 50/50 measurements of 0 and 1. This sudden asymmetry in syndrome values is a marker of CREs, especially if seen growing in a ring. In Fig. 5 and other places, we will designate the time at which a CRE is unequivocally detected either \\(\\Delta\\) or Delta.\n\nComplementing the hardware strategies above, software (including the flexible elements of error correction) can contribute to solving the problem in ways we study in several sections. The simplest solution is to use a code distance that results in physical hole separation exceeding the dissipation radius \\(r_{\\text{max}}\\). However, the hole must also have a radius \\(>r_{\\text{max}}\\), or the phonon front can consume a single hole. Such a large physical radius is likely impractical, so we investigate a more dynamic approach in the next section.\n\n## IV Flight: Detection and Escape\n\nOur proposed strategy is to _flee the area_: move logical qubits far enough from the strike's epicenter to preserve our logical information. This is more easily accomplished using the 2-D surface code than other codes. In addition, as the state remains vulnerable during the move or while we maneuver other holes to allow us to move a particular hole, we must examine how well we can protect the logical qubit state in these cases.\n\nImplementing this strategy will involve several phases. With time measured in units of the surface code cycle time \\(t_{c}\\), assume detection of a hit in time \\(t=\\Delta\\) and an immediate and accurate response after that time. With phonon propagation velocity \\(v_{p}\\), the phonon front has advanced to a ring of radius \\(r_{\\Delta}=\\Delta v_{p}\\) before software mitigation begins. The steps above are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5.\n\nFirst, consider the unconstrained movement of a single hole. The complete sequence of events is as follows:\n\n1. \\(t=0\\): The cosmic ray event occurs.\n2. \\(t=\\Delta\\): The strike is detected via a combination of hardware and software.\n3. \\(t=\\Delta+1\\): The move of the hole(s) begins.\n4. \\(t=\\Delta+1+d\\): The move completes.\n5. \\(t=\\frac{r_{\\text{max}}}{v_{p}}\\): The logical data (hole) waits out the storm as the phonons dissipate. With appropriate management of resources, continuing the planned computation during the storm should be possible.\n\nFig. 5: The hole can flee any distance along an available rectilinear path in a fixed amount of time.

However, this reduction in code distance naturally reduces the physical distance between holes, and this tradeoff is investigated below.\n\n### _Software strategies_\n\nOnce the hardware requirements are met, the next step is software. As mentioned earlier, the idea is to move the logical qubit far enough to prevent the CRE from destroying it. In this paper, as in our previous work [18], we only consider errors caused by cosmic rays. We assume that the code distance has been set to suppress logical state errors due to ordinary decoherence thoroughly enough that we can ignore them.\n\nWe must be able to detect a cosmic ray strike as quickly as possible. While the details of such a determination remain to be determined, we can describe the general outline. As noted earlier, CREs preferentially result in 50/50 measurements of 0 and 1. This sudden asymmetry in syndrome values is a marker of CREs, especially if seen growing in a ring. In Fig. 5 and other places, we will designate the time at which a CRE is unequivocally detected either \\(\\Delta\\) or Delta.\n\nComplementing the hardware strategies above, software (including the flexible elements of error correction) can contribute to solving the problem in ways we study in several sections. The simplest solution is to use a code distance that results in physical hole separation exceeding the dissipation radius \\(r_{\\text{max}}\\). However, the hole must also have a radius \\(>r_{\\text{max}}\\), or the phonon front can consume a single hole. Such a large physical radius is likely impractical, so we investigate a more dynamic approach in the next section.\n\n## IV Flight: Detection and Escape\n\nOur proposed strategy is to _flee the area_: move logical qubits far enough from the strike's epicenter to preserve our logical information. This is more easily accomplished using the 2-D surface code than other codes. In addition, as the state remains vulnerable during the move or while we maneuver other holes to allow us to move a particular hole, we must examine how well we can protect the logical qubit state in these cases.\n\nImplementing this strategy will involve several phases. With time measured in units of the surface code cycle time \\(t_{c}\\), assume detection of a hit in time \\(t=\\Delta\\) and an immediate and accurate response after that time. With phonon propagation velocity \\(v_{p}\\), the phonon front has advanced to a ring of radius \\(r_{\\Delta}=\\Delta v_{p}\\) before software mitigation begins. The steps above are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5.\n\nFirst, consider the unconstrained movement of a single hole. The complete sequence of events is as follows:\n\n1. \\(t=0\\): The cosmic ray event occurs.\n2. \\(t=\\Delta\\): The strike is detected via a combination of hardware and software.\n3. \\(t=\\Delta+1\\): The move of the hole(s) begins.\n4. \\(t=\\Delta+1+d\\): The move completes.\n5. \\(t=\\frac{r_{\\text{max}}}{v_{p}}\\): The logical data (hole) waits out the storm as the phonons dissipate. With appropriate management of resources, continuing the planned computation during the storm should be possible.\n\nFig. 5: The hole can flee any distance along an available rectilinear path in a fixed amount of time. Max size at \\(t=r_{\\text{max}}/v_{p}\\), move begins at \\(t=\\Delta+1\\), detection at \\(t=\\Delta\\), event at \\(t=0\\).\n\nFig. 6: An example of multi-qubit mapping using 2-D array surface codes. In this mapping, the detection time determines the qubits\u2019 movement order. Wherever the CRE is detected, it enables easy qubit moves and limits time steps for moving our logical qubits.\n\n "]}, {"edit": ["3. **Application of a Unitary Transformation:** In this part of the circuit, a series of Quantum gates are applied to the initial states.

Furthermore, we suggest a method for detecting the motion of magnetic nanoparticles, which is challenging with conventional interference-based sensors. To achieve this, we derive the closed exact form of the Berry curvature corresponding to NV centers and design quenching protocols to extract the Berry curvature via dynamical response. By constructing and solving non-linear equations, the magnetic field and instantaneous motion velocity of the magnetic nanoparticle can be deduced. We investigate the feasibility of our sensing scheme in the presence of decoherence and show through numerical simulations that it is robust to decoherence. Intriguingly, we have observed that a vanishing nuclear spin polarization in diamond actually benefits our dynamic sensing scheme, which stands in contrast to conventional Ramsey-based schemes. In comparison to Ramsey-based sensing schemes, our proposed scheme can sense an arbitrary time-dependent magnetic field, as long as its time dependence is nearly adiabatic.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nQuantum metrology [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and quantum sensing [7, 8] have attracted significant attention in recent years. Quantum sensors, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems, hold promise for detecting weak or nanoscale signals that surpass the capabilities of classical sensors. While most quantum sensors rely on interference schemes, there are situations where implementing interferometry or Ramsey-based schemes becomes challenging [9, 10].

Specifically, we use the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond to realize both scalar and vector magnetometry via quantum response. Furthermore, we suggest a method for detecting the motion of magnetic nanoparticles, which is challenging with conventional interference-based sensors. To achieve this, we derive the closed exact form of the Berry curvature corresponding to NV centers and design quenching protocols to extract the Berry curvature via dynamical response. By constructing and solving non-linear equations, the magnetic field and instantaneous motion velocity of the magnetic nanoparticle can be deduced. We investigate the feasibility of our sensing scheme in the presence of decoherence and show through numerical simulations that it is robust to decoherence. Intriguingly, we have observed that a vanishing nuclear spin polarization in diamond actually benefits our dynamic sensing scheme, which stands in contrast to conventional Ramsey-based schemes. In comparison to Ramsey-based sensing schemes, our proposed scheme can sense an arbitrary time-dependent magnetic field, as long as its time dependence is nearly adiabatic.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nQuantum metrology [1, 2, 361005 Fujian, China, 361005 Fujian, China, 361005 Fujian, China] and quantum sensing [36, 30] have attracted significant attention in recent years. Quantum sensors, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems, hold promise for detecting weak or nanoscale signals that surpass the capabilities of classical sensors. While most quantum sensors rely on interference schemes, there are situations where implementing interferometry or Ramsey-based schemes becomes challenging [38, 39]. One such scenario arises when the signal to be detected exhibits a short period of viability, making it impractical to accumulate the necessary phase for information encoding in the interference-based scheme [3]. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on exploring novel mechanisms to realize innovative quantum sensing schemes, driving rapid developments in the field of quantum science and technology [36, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30].\n\nIn recent studies [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], the concept of dynamical response has been proposed as a means to detect geometric quantities in quantum many-body systems. Notably, the emergence of Berry curvature in the nonadiabatic response of physical observables to slow quenches, irrespective of the system's interaction nature, has been identified [34]. Building upon these findings, our study showcases the potential of utilizing the mechanism of dynamic response for quantum sensing, offering a complementary approach to the conventional interference-based sensing schemes. Specifically, we present quantum response-based sensing schemes utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond [31, 32]. The NV center in diamond is a highly attractive candidate for quantum sensing due to its efficient initialization and readout capabilities through optical excitations, as well as its relatively long coherence time, even at ambient temperature [3, 33]. Consequently, extensive theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted to explore the quantum sensing potential of NV centers [39, 40, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Notably, NV centers have demonstrated the ability to sense magnetic fields with nanoscale spatial resolution [32, 31]. Besides, the geometric quantity, like the geometric phase, in NV centers has been investigated [35, 36] and proposed in the applications in quantum sensing, like gyroscope [34, 37] and magnetometer [38].

We will see that the essential physics discussed in the main text is independent of the range \\(r\\).\n\nWe start by showing our diagnostics for the phase transition in Fig. 6. Notice that in this case, we do not have analytic expressions for the size of the largest Krylov sector as in the case of \\(r=1\\). So we implement the recursive algorithm outlined in the main text, which works independent of the range \\(r\\). The ratio \\(D_{\\text{max}}/D_{\\text{sum}}\\) exhibits a qualitative change at the critial density \\(n_{c}\\approx 0.33\\) [Fig. 6(a)]. For \\(n<n_{c}\\), the largest Krylov sector constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the full symmetry sector in the thermodynamic limit, indicative of strong fragmentation. The ratio decays exponentially with \\(L\\) upon increasing system size in this regime [Fig. 6(b)]. For \\(n>n_{c}\\), the ratio approaches order one, indicating weak fragmentation, and the system thermalizes with high probability from a random initial state. At the critical point, \\(D_{\\text{max}}/D_{\\text{sum}}\\) again shows a power-law decay with system size as \\(L^{-1}\\). We can similarly consider the fraction of frozen sites averaged over all configurations in a symmetry sector as a function of the filling, which serves as an order parameter for the transition. This order parameter changes from zero to nonzero at the critical \\(n_{c}\\), as shown in Fig. 6(d). Notice that the position of the critical point is again in excellent agreement with the general expression \\(n_{c}=\\frac{1}{r+1}\\), which is equal to \\(1/3\\) for \\(r=2\\).\n\nWe also consider the process of thermal inclusion in this case, for which numerical results are summarized in Fig. 7.

As one of the most important bosonic codes, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is proposed to correct small displacement error in phase space. If the noise in phase space is biased, square-lattice GKP code can be concatenated with XZZX surface code or repetition code that promises a high fault-tolerant threshold to suppress the logical error. In this work, we study the performance of GKP repetition codes with physical ancillary GKP qubits in correcting biased noise.

As one of the most important bosonic codes, GottesmanKitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is proposed to correct small displacement error in phase space. If the noise in phase space is biased, square-lattice GKP code can be concatenated with XZZX surface code or repetition code that promises a high fault-tolerant threshold to suppress the logical error. In this work, we study the performance of GKP repetition codes with physical ancillary GKP qubits in correcting biased noise. We find that there exists a critical value of noise variance for the ancillary GKP qubit such that the logical Pauli error rate decreases when increasing the code size. Furthermore, one round of GKP error correction has to be performed before concatenating with repetition code. Our study paves the way for practical implementation of error correction by concatenating GKP code with low-level qubit codes.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nNoise is the main hindrance to achieve large-scale faulttolerant quantum computation. Quantum error correcting code is introduced to correct errors by using redundancy in the Hilbert space [ 1 \u2013 3 ]. Bosonic codes protect finitedimensional logical space by encoding it in an infinitedimensional bosonic quantum system [ 4 , 5 ], e.g., a simple harmonic oscillator. Compared to the standard qubit codes that encode a single logical qubit using many physical qubits, the bosonic code is more hardware efficient and is subject to a smaller number of noisy channels [ 6 , 7 ]. Currently well established bosonic codes include GottesmanKitaev-Preskill (GKP) code [ 8 , 9 ], cat code [ 10 , 11 ], binomial code [ 12 \u2013 14 ], and rotation-symmetric code [ 15 , 16 ]. The GKP code is one of the most promising bosonic codes, which corrects small displacement errors in phase space and also photon loss [ 6 , 17 ]. Although the GKP code has been proposed for two decades [ 8 ], it is prepared only recently in ion-trapped [ 18 , 19 ] and superconducting [ 20 ] platforms, and is used to extend the decoherence time of the logical qubit through error correction. The GKP code has promising advantages in optical quantum information processing [ 21 ], however optical GKP states have not been experimentally generated due to the stringent requirement for strong nonlinearity, though various preparation schemes have been proposed [ 22 \u2013 26 ]. In order to achieve fault tolerance, the common strategy is to concatenate the GKP code with qubit codes to further suppress the logical error. Examples include concatenation with surface/toric codes [ 27 \u2013 32 ], color code [ 33 \u2013 35 ] etc. Concatenation with qubit codes with a high threshold enables a low squeezing threshold for the GKP states around 10 dB [ 27 ], which is within the reach of nearterm technologies. A variant of the original surface code, known as the XZZX surface code [ 36 ], has recently been shown to have a higher threshold for biased noise. It is expected that concatenation of GKP code with XZZX surface code would enable lower squeezing threshold if the displacement error is biased [ 37 ]. This can happen in two cases, either the noise is biased and a square-lattice (isotropic) GKP code is used, or the noise is isotropic and a biased GKP code is used. However, syndrome measurement and decoding are still complicated for the XZZX surface code [ 38 ], which therefore consume more physical and computational resources. A relatively easier scheme to suppress biased noise is to concatenate GKP code with repetition code [39 ], which requires easier syndrome measurement and decoding, and has a higher threshold. In Ref. [ 39 ], the error threshold has been estimated for biased GKP repetition code with isotropic noise, which outperforms the biased planar surface code"]}, {"edit": ["theory is asymptotically free, like non-Abelian gauge theories.\n\nAs mentioned above one can try to qubitize this theory by substituting the target space (the unit sphere \\(S^{2}\\)) by a finite set of points equally spaced over the sphere (i.e., the vertices of Platonic solids).

The relative entropy of magic, the stabilizer fidelity, and the generalized robustness of magic are instances of magic monotones based on a quantum relative entropy and can be defined for any resource theory. A fundamental problem is whether the magic monotones based on a quantum relative entropy are additive under tensor products, and if not, under which conditions they become additive. However, very little is known about the additivity properties of these monotones. Besides its theoretical interest, the latter property is practically useful since it allows us to reduce the computation of the magic resource of the 'whole' to just the sum of one of the 'parts'. The computation of these monotones becomes soon unfeasible for multi-qubit states as the number of qubits grows. This is because the number of pure stabilizer states scales super-exponentially with the number of qubits. For numerical experiments, we are limited to just five-qubit states [19; 32]. The additivity property allows us to overcome this problem for tensor products of low-dimensional multi-qubit states. In this case, the total magic resource just equals the sum of the one of each state, which is computable.\n\nThe additivity property allows us to compute upper bounds for state transformations. In particular, we can obtain upper bounds for the ratio \\(m/k\\) in the transformation \\(\\rho^{\\otimes k}\\rightarrow\\sigma^{\\otimes m}\\) under free operations. Moreover, the results on the relative entropy of magic allow us to derive upper bounds for asymptotic state transformation. In this way, we obtain much tighter bounds for one-shot state transformation than the one previously known, which used the generalized robustness. Moreover, we obtain new (closed-form) upper bounds for transformations involving specific two and three-qubit mixed states, e.g. the depolarized Toffoli state (see Section 6 for more details).\n\nWe now summarize the main results of this work.\n\n* In Section 3, we prove that the stabilizer fidelity is multiplicative for tensor products of any number of single-qubit states. We then extend this result to include a continuous set of magic monotones, namely all the \\(\\alpha\\)-\\(z\\) Renyi relative entropies of magic in the range \\(|(1-\\alpha)/z|=1\\). In this way, we also independently recover the multiplicativity of the generalized robustness of magic for all single-qubit states established in [32].\n* In Section 4, we prove that the relative entropy of magic is additive for single-qubit states if all of them but one commute with their optimizer, i.e. the closest stabilizer state. Moreover, in Section 8, we show that the latter class includes the \\(T\\),\\(H\\), and \\(F\\) states subject to depolarizing noise. These are the states involved in the standard magic state distillation scenario where any initial state is first projected onto a symmetry axis of the octahedron by applying the stabilizer twirling, from which one aims to distill a better pure magic state [7; 8].

However, its applications in quantum technologies usually also require estimating the difference between prepared and target quantum states with reliable confidence intervals. In this work, we suggest a computationally efficient and reliable scheme for determining well-justified error bars for quantum tomography. We approximate the probability distribution of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the target state and the estimation, which is given by the linear inversion, by calculating its moments. We also present a generalization of this approach for quantum process tomography. We benchmark our approach for a number of quantum tomography protocols using both simulated and experimental data. The obtained results pave a way to the use of the suggested scheme for complete characterization of quantum systems of various nature.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nQuantum technologies strongly require the ability to prepare quantum states with desired properties [1].

In this regard, one of crucial tasks is to estimate the difference between the states that are actually prepared and the desired one, which requires solving the problem of complete characterization of quantum states and processes. The art of solving this problem is known as quantum tomography that uses the measurement statistics in multiple bases (for a review, see Ref. [ 2 ]). Being a gold standard in quantum physics experiments, quantum tomography is routinely performed for systems of various nature, ranging from quantum-optical states [ 3 ] to trapped-ion quantum simulators [ 4 ]. However, along with the various benefits, this method encounters a number of challenges. The first issue related to the efficiency of quantum tomography, which becomes unwieldy for large and complex quantum systems, which are required for quantum technologies [ 5 ]. A number of methods for improving the performance of quantum tomography protocols have been suggested [ 4 , 6 \u2013 10 ], and the latest results are related to the use of neural-network quantum state representation for tomographic reconstruction [ 9 \u2013 13 ]. Another important issue is supplying quantum tomography protocols with efficient methods for the estimation of their reconstruction accuracy [ 14 \u2013 23 ]. Most of the existing practical techniques for estimating the accuracy of quantum tomography protocols are based on heuristic approaches, while only a few methods are established rigorously [ 21 , 23 \u2013 25 ]. Existing approaches for solving this problem encounter an obstacle of combining computational efficiency, which takes place for heuristic methods, and provable accuracy, which is a feature of rigorous methods (however, their estimations are typically quite pessimistic so that yielding error bars, which are unnecessarily large). Consequently, finding a tradeoff between the computational efficiency of the method and provable accuracy is highly important for ongoing experiments. This problem becomes even more significant for quantum process tomography (QPT) [ 24 \u2013 28 ], which is an important tool for characterizing the quality of operations performed by quantum devices [ 29 , 30 ]. In this work, we present a computationally-efficient approach for solving this problem, which demonstrates the best performance among existing rigorous approaches. The idea is that the probability distribution of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the experimentally prepared state and the estimation, which is given by the linear inversion, can be approximated by calculating its moments. We benchmark our approach for a number of quantum tomography protocols for states and processes using both simulated and experimental data, where the latter are generated using a publicly accessible superconducting quantum processor. As we expect, our results provide a computationally efficient and still rigorously justified approach for quantum tomography of states and processes. Our work is organized as follows. In Sec. II , we provide a short description of the general quantum state tomography protocol (QST) for a finite-dimensional system. In Sec. III , we discuss rigorous confidence regions for QST. In Sec. IV , we present a generalization of the method of obtaining confidence regions for QPT. In Sec. V , we describe a method of computing confidence intervals in terms of more practical metrics, such as fidelity or mean value of observable. In Sec. VI , we present a performance analysis of our approach, where we use several quantum states, in particular, 3-qubit GHZ state, for the QST, and also single-qubit depolarizing"]}, {"edit": ["cellent agreement with the analytical results, verifying their consistency under weak driving conditions.

The most interesting flat bands are the ones displaying a complex structure of the Bloch states, not ascribable to a trivial atomic limit. The crucial role of Bloch state geometry for (quasi-)condensation [4; 5; 6] and superfluid transport [7; 8] has been pointed out.\n\nIn analogy to the case of weakly interacting atomic BECs [9; 6], it is natural to consider lasing in flat band systems in a semi-classical approximation. In such a non-Hermitian context, however, one needs to specify whether the flatness condition applies to the real or imaginary part of the single-particle dispersion relation. In this work, we are interested in studying the case where the Bloch geometry stabilizes a lasing state _in a purely non-linear fashion_, as due to gain competition. This goes beyond a number of recent results in topological lasers [10; 11] and polariton condensation on the Lieb lattice [12], where a privileged Bloch state enjoys a larger gain or quality factor _already at the linear level_. In other words, we consider single-particle bands that are flat both in their real and imaginary parts.\n\nMoreover, a question specific to non-equilibrium one-dimensional quasi-condenstates concerns the fate of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics [13; 14; 15; 16] in a flat band. Indeed, the KPZ nonlinearity is typically proportional to the bandwidth in the case of a dispersive band without quantum geometry.\n\nThis Letter starts by introducing the semi-classical lasing equations on the diamond chain and a real space projection method to the lowest flat band. The geometry of the Bloch states determines the steady-state lasing mode and the collective modes, calculated by the Bogoliubov method. We then go beyond Bogoliubov introducing stochastic noise and allowing for large phase fluctuations. Adiabatically eliminating density fluctuations yields an equation for the phase with a full cancellation of a candidate nonlinear KPZ term, which is proportional to a Bloch geometric constant. To check this remarkable conclusion, we perform numerical simulations that display full agreement with the analytical argument. Finally, we discuss connections with previous works on flat bands [17; 18; 12] and outline future directions.\n\n_Model and projection._ We consider lasing in a semi-classical framework, particularly adequate for lattices of microring laser resonators [19], polariton micropillars [20] and VCSEL's arrays [21].

In this work, we are interested in studying the case where the Bloch geometry stabilizes a lasing state _in a purely non-linear fashion_, as due to gain competition. This goes beyond a number of recent results in topological lasers [10, 11] and polariton condensation on the Lieb lattice [12], where a privileged Bloch state enjoys a larger gain or quality factor _already at the linear level_. In other words, we consider single-particle bands that are flat both in their real and imaginary parts. Moreover, a question specific to non-equilibrium onedimensional quasi-condenstates concerns the fate of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics [13\u201316] in a flat band. Indeed, the KPZ nonlinearity is typically proportional to the bandwidth in the case of a dispersive band without quantum geometry. This Letter starts by introducing the semi-classical lasing equations on the diamond chain and a real space projection method to the lowest flat band. The geometry of the Bloch states determines the steady-state lasing mode and the collective modes, calculated by the Bogoliubov method. We then go beyond Bogoliubov introducing stochastic noise and allowing for large phase fluctuations. Adiabatically eliminating density fluctuations yields an equation for the phase with a full cancellation of a candidate nonlinear KPZ term, which is proportional to a Bloch geometric constant. To check this remarkable conclusion, we perform numerical simulations that display full agreement with the analytical argument. Finally, we discuss connections with previous works on flat bands [12, 17, 18] and outline future directions.\n\n_Model and projection._ We consider lasing in a semiclassical framework, particularly adequate for lattices of microring laser resonators [19], polariton micropillars [20] and VCSEL\u2019s arrays [21]. While a slow carrier dynamics can in practice give rise to further instabilities [11, 17, 22, 23], here we assume that the adiabatic approximation holds.

In the present case, the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional derived from mean-field theory features many energetically degenerate ground states. For instance, mean-field theory does not dictate whether time-reversal symmetry is broken or not at the transition. This degeneracy of ground states at the mean-field level is common in similar systems such as bulk He-3 [1], d-wave superconductivity in 3D [34; 35], triple-point fermions [36], or complex tensor order [37; 38]. Remarkably, we find that in the present case, the many degenerate ground states actually only consists of two physically inequivalent configurations, the A-phase and the planar phase, whereas all other minima are related to these two via a symmetry transformation from \\(\\tilde{G}\\).\n\nTo resolve the question of whether the A-phase or the planar phase is energetically favored, we apply two theoretical approaches. First, we use the best available strong-coupling corrections for the Landau free energy from the 3D system and confirm that the A-phase is favored at the transition for all pressures. Second, we use weak-coupling perturbative renormalization group (RG) to incorporate order parameter fluctuations in the confined system, which predicts the planar phase to be favorable instead. This mismatch with observations indicates that even low pressures do not correspond to a weak coupling, but we also speculate on general issues of the perturbative RG to resolve second-order phase transitions of matrix order parameters. The lifting of the mean-field degeneracy due to fluctuations in the RG is unlike the case discussed in Ref. [36], where the degeneracy is protected by an enlarged symmetry. Experimentally, measuring the absence or presence of time-reversal symmetry at the transition could determine the condensation of the A-phase or planar phase, respectively.\n\n## I Physical Picture: The Cooper Problem\n\nTo illuminate the effect of confinement on the superfluid state, we first examine the associated Cooper problem. This amounts to solving the two-particle Schrodinger equation in the presence of a static Fermi surface (FS). The formation of a bound state, the Cooper pair, and its functional dependence on the system parameters is often a good approximation of the superfluid instability found within mean-field theory for the actual many-body system, such as in spin- or mass-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gases [39].\n\nIn the original Cooper problem, two atoms in 3D that experience a two-dimensional FS are interacting attractively, which leads to the formation of a shallow bound state. The atoms are described by the two-particle Schrodinger equation\n\n\\[\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{4m}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}}^{2}-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m}\\nabla_{ \\mathbf{r}}^{2}-2\\mu-V(r)\\right]\\psi(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{r})=E\\psi(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r}), \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{R}=(X,Y,Z)^{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)^{T}\\) are the center-of-mass and relative coordinates of the two atoms, respectively, \\(\\mu\\) is the chemical potential, and \\(V(r)\\) the interaction potential.

In Sec. II, we confirm this perspective within the framework of mean-field theory. We show that the \\(3\\times 3\\) order parameter splits into two sub-order parameters with different transition temperatures: a \\(3\\times 2\\) matrix and a \\(3\\times 1\\) matrix. We find that the \\(3\\times 2\\) matrix has a higher transition temperature and is thus the only relevant order parameter at the superfluid transition.\n\nA fascinating problem, inherent to symmetry breaking described by matrix order parameters in general, concerns the question of which particular matrix is chosen during spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the present case, the Ginzburg\u2013Landau free energy functional derived from mean-field theory features many energetically degenerate ground states. For instance, mean-field theory does not dictate whether time-reversal symmetry is broken or not at the transition. This degeneracy of ground states at the mean-field level is common in similar systems such as bulk He-3 [1], d-wave superconductivity in 3D [34, 35], triple-point fermions [36], or complex tensor order [37, 38].

This method is inherited from the quantum covariance matrix in hermitian systems. We apply our method in spin chain with Lee-Yang edge singularity and a non-Hermitian interacting fermion model. The numerical results accurately reproduce the input parent Hamiltonian in both cases. Then we discuss how to extend current approach for further application, including phase expansion, reconstruction for non-degenerate/degenerate biorthogonal eigenstates and detecting local conserved quantities in non-Hermitian systems.\n\nOur proposal answers non-Hermitian quantum inverse problem in a general sense and opens up several new directions of exploring non-Hermitian physics guided by biorthogonal eigenstates. We believe that more novel and meaningful non-Hermitian Hamiltonians could be established and some underlying symmetry could be revealed through our approach. Besides, it will be interesting to reconstruct local entanglement Hamiltonian in non-Hermitian systems using our methods and discover conserved quantities associated with it, in parallel to the work in Hermitian systems [89, 44].\n\nFrom numerical perspective, our scalable recipe paves the way for future studies of non-Hermitian inverse problem using matrix product state, tensor network and other computational methods available to the higher dimensions. The potential of generalized quantum covariance matrix should remain accessible at moderate system sizes.\n\nFrom the experimental side, our work offers a straightforward way to search desired non-Hermitian parent Hamiltonian from controllable interaction. We anticipate it will be pretty meaningful and helpful for the designment of non-Hermitian models for experimentalists.\n\n###### Acknowledgements.\n\n We acknowledge useful discussions with Qicheng Tang, Xingbo Wei, Yingfei Gu and Zhong Wang.

This method is inherited from the quantum covariance matrix in hermitian systems. We apply our method in spin chain with Lee-Yang edge singularity and a non-Hermitian interacting fermion model. The numerical results accurately reproduce the input parent Hamiltonian in both cases. Then we discuss how to extend current approach for further application, including phase expansion, reconstruction for nondegenerate/degenerate biorthogonal eigenstates and detecting local conserved quantities in non-Hermitian systems.\n\nOur proposal answers non-Hermitian quantum inverse problem in a general sense and opens up several new directions of exploring non-Hermitian physics guided by biorthogonal eigenstates. We believe that more novel and meaningful non-Hermitian Hamiltonians could be established and some underlying symmetry could be revealed through our approach. Besides, it will be interesting to reconstruct local entanglement Hamiltonian in nonHermitian systems using our methods and discover conserved quantities associated with it, in parallel to the work in Hermitian systems [44, 89].\n\nFrom numerical perspective, our scalable recipe paves the way for future studies of non-Hermitian inverse problem using matrix product state, tensor network and other computational methods available to the higher dimensions. The potential of generalized quantum covariance matrix should remain accessible at moderate system sizes.\n\nFrom the experimental side, our work offers a straightward way to search desired non-Hermitian parent Hamiltonian from controllable interaction. We anticipate it will be pretty meaningful and helpful for the designment of non-Hermitian models for experimentalists.\n\n###### Acknowledgements.\n\n We acknowledge useful discussions with Qicheng Tang, Xingbo Wei, Yingfei Gu and Zhong Wang.

Non-zero negativity values indicate the presence of quantum correlations in the form of entanglement, being greater the greater the amount of entanglement present.\n\nWe computed \\(G^{(2)}(0)\\) in Figs. 7(a),(c),(e) and \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\rho)\\) in Figs. 7(b),(d), (f) as a function of coupling strength for different number of qubits. In Figs. 7(e),(f) we set \\(N=8\\) and investigated the effect of different temperatures on the quantumness of the work substance. Note that the quantum correlations are degraded by increasing the number \\(N\\) of qubits and increasing the temperature \\(T_{h}\\), whereas \\(\\eta\\) and \\(\\xi\\) increase with the number of qubits for all temperatures. If we compare the Figs. 7(a)-(f) showing maximum antibunching and maximum entanglement with Figs 4(a)-(f) and 5(a)-(b), which respectively show efficiency and COP, we will see that there is no correspondence between the maximum of quantum correlations and the maximum of efficiency and COP. As far as the second-order correlation is concerned, the efficiency is higher in the deep strong coupling regime (\\(\\lambda>2\\)), Figs. 4(b),(e), and therefore, far from the region where the second-order correlation shows the sub-Poissonian effect. The same conclusion can be drawn from Fig.5(a)-(c) for the COP, whose maxima lie in regions far from the value of the critical parameter \\(\\lambda\\). With regard to negativity, Figs.7(b), (d), and (f) show that the maximum of negativity, and therefore of entanglement, does not coincide with the maximum of efficiency and COP. For example, in Fig. 4(b) for \\(T_{c}=0.1\\) and various values of \\(N\\), the efficiency is practically constant with the coupling parameter, and therefore independent of the amount of entanglement, whereas in Fig.7(b) the negativity, also at \\(T_{c}=0.1\\) and the various values of \\(N\\) presents maximums and minimums when varying the coupling parameter. The same can be said about the COP: there is nothing in the analysis of the maximums that indicates the relevance of negativity for its improvement. Take for example Fig.7(d) for \\(T_{c}=2\\), where negativity remains zero for a large range of values of \\(\\lambda\\) and then increases monotonically until to \\(\\lambda=2\\), with similar behavior even for different values of \\(N\\). Compare with Fig.5(c), where the COP has a very different behavior depending on \\(N\\), with no correspondence with negativity. These same conclusions are supported by additional numerical calculations that we performed (not shown here). To summarize this Section, and as previously mentioned, we point out that the improvement in the efficiency and performance of the UQOHM using the Dicke model as the working substance cannot be attributed to quantum resources [99; 100], but it is due to the high anharmonicity of the spectrum around the critical point of the Dicke model.\n\n## V Conclusion\n\nIn summary, in this work we propose a universal quantum Otto heat machine (UQOHM) based on the open Dicke model (ODM). The ODM is composed of N atoms of two levels (qubits) that interact with a mode of the electromagnetic field and both the mode and the N qubits, which constitute the working substance of the universal machine, interact with thermal reservoirs. This model presents a critical point and can be solved analytically in the thermodynamic limit \\(N\\rightarrow\\infty\\). By universal thermal machine we mean that it is possible, by adjusting the atom-field coupling parameter \\(\\lambda\\) of the ODM, to build all types of thermal machines, namely engines, refrigerators, heaters, and accelerators.

We identified the boundaries of this semiclassically forbidden region through Monte-Carlo sampling of semiclassical spin states (i.e., those states constrained to the surface of the Bloch sphere) followed by gradient descent to the lowest possible energy state. We find that entanglement enables the quantum spins to follow trajectories (through the Bloch sphere interior) that bypass this semiclassical energy barrier. This allows the quantum spin network to reach lower-energy steady-state configurations. Slower ramps could allow the semiclassical trajectories to follow a more adiabatic path back downward to similarly low-energy states. However, we find that such ramps must be at least an order-of-magnitude slower than those considered here.\n\nThe steady-state energy of the quantum trajectories seems to be primarily controlled by the ramp rate.

By contrast, spin glasses are characterized by nearly degenerate spin configurations that become exponentially numerous with \\(N\\). This results in much smaller gaps near the transition and nonadiabatic evolution is more likely to occur, as we see in Fig. 4(b). The chosen ramp rate is slow enough to prevent nonadiabatic transitions to highly excited states, but not enough to prevent transitions to the nearly degenerate local minima states. Unitary evolution through the transition then produces an entangled superposition of low-energy states, as seen in Fig. 2, before projection into a single spin state occurs.

We perform numerical experiments on stabilizer codes with small code distances, using both depolarizing error models and error models with correlated noise. The results show that our approach provides significantly better decoding accuracy than the minimum weight perfect matching and belief-propagation-based algorithms. Our framework is general and can be applied to any error model and quantum codes with different topologies such as surface codes and quantum LDPC codes. Furthermore, it leverages the parallelization capabilities of GPUs, enabling simultaneous decoding of a large number of syndromes. Our approach sheds light on the efficient and accurate decoding of quantum error-correcting codes using generative artificial intelligence and modern computational power.\n\nQuantum computers can potentially solve practical problems which are intractable for classical computers. However, the current implementation of quantum computers has an issue with noise, which limits its power. An essential step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing is quantum error correction (QEC), which now becomes one of the key research frontiers in both theoretical studies and hardware developments [1, 2] of quantum computation [3]. In QEC, logical states with \\(k\\) logical qubits are encoded using \\(n\\) physical qubits with redundancy. The effects of continuous errors can be digitalized into a finite set of discrete errors, which can be obtained by measuring the redundant ancilla qubits, giving an error syndrome. Then a decoding algorithm infers the information of errors based on the syndrome and determines an appropriate operation to correct the logical error. However, the decoding problem is a hard problem, for example, it belongs to the class of #P hard problem in the classical error-correcting codes. In quantum codes, decoding is considered to be more challenging than classical code, because the errors inherently degenerate, and the corresponding factor graph for the codes is more complex, for example, in CSS code the factor graph always contains loops with various sizes due to the commutation relations, so standard decoding algorithms such as belief propagation do not work as well as in classical low-density parity check (LDPC) codes.\n\nWhile a number of algorithms have been proposed for decoding quantum error-correcting codes, we lack general decoding algorithms that are efficient and accurate. The minimum weight perfect matching algorithm [4, 5] can decode surface code efficiently, however, as a minimum-weight decoder ignores the degeneracy of quantum codes, in principle its performance usually has a gap to the theoretical limit. Moreover, it is less efficient in non-planar graphs and is challenging when applied to code on hypergraphs where the distances between two nodes are not well defined. As a prototype of the maximum likelihood decoder (MLD), tensor network methods (e.g. the boundary matrix product state method [6]) consider the degeneracies of quantum codes and work close"], "nougat": ["\n\n# qecGPT: decoding Quantum Error-correcting Codes with Generative Pre-trained Transformers\n\nHanyan Cao, 1, 2 Feng Pan, 1, 2\n\nYijia Wang, 1, 3, 4, 5\n\nPan Zhang\n\n1CAS Key Laboratory for Theoretical Physics, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China School of Mathematical Physics and Mathematical Sciences, Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, UCAS, Hangzhou 3100049, China International Centre for Theoretical Physics Asia-Pacific, Beijing/Hangzhou, China\n\n###### Abstract\n\nWe propose a general framework for decoding quantum error-correcting codes with generative modeling.

We perform numerical experiments on stabilizer codes with small code distances, using both depolarizing error models and error models with correlated noise. The results show that our approach provides significantly better decoding accuracy than the minimum weight perfect matching and belief-propagation-based algorithms. Our framework is general and can be applied to any error model and quantum codes with different topologies such as surface codes and quantum LDPC codes. Furthermore, it leverages the parallelization capabilities of GPUs, enabling simultaneous decoding of a large number of syndromes. Our approach sheds light on the efficient and accurate decoding of quantum error-correcting codes using generative artificial intelligence and modern computational power.\n\nQuantum computers can potentially solve practical problems which are intractable for classical computers. However, the current implementation of quantum computers has an issue with noise, which limits its power. An essential step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing is quantum error correction (QEC), which now becomes one of the key research frontiers in both theoretical studies and hardware developments [1, 2] of quantum computation [3]. In QEC, logical states with \\(k\\) logical qubits are encoded using \\(n\\) physical qubits with redundancy. The effects of continuous errors can be digitalized into a finite set of discrete errors, which can be obtained by measuring the redundant ancilla qubits, giving an error syndrome. Then a decoding algorithm infers the information of errors based on the syndrome and determines an appropriate operation to correct the logical error. However, the decoding problem is a hard problem, for example, it belongs to the class of #P hard problem in the classical error-correcting codes. In quantum codes, decoding is considered to be more challenging than classical code, because the errors inherently degenerate, and the corresponding factor graph for the codes is more complex, for example, in CSS code the factor graph always contains loops with various sizes due to the commutation relations, so standard decoding algorithms such as belief propagation do not work as well as in classical low-density parity check (LDPC) codes.\n\nWhile a number of algorithms have been proposed for decoding quantum error-correcting codes, we lack general decoding algorithms that are efficient and accurate. The minimum weight perfect matching algorithm [4, 5] can decode surface code efficiently, however, as a minimum-weight decoder ignores the degeneracy of quantum codes, in principle its performance usually has a gap to the theoretical limit. Moreover, it is less efficient in non-planar graphs and is challenging when applied to code on hypergraphs where the distances between two nodes are not well defined. As a prototype of the maximum likelihood decoder (MLD), tensor network methods (e.g. the boundary matrix product state method [6]) consider the degeneracies of quantum codes and work close to the theoretical limit in surface code. However, for general codes not defined on lattices with open boundaries, the tensor network contractions are difficult to apply due to the large treewidth of the graph. Another issue for existing maximum-likelihood decoders is computing probabilities for \\(4^{k}\\) logical operators for \\(k\\) logical qubits, which is intractable for a large \\(k\\). Moreover, the contraction of tensor networks for each syndrome consumes significantly more computational resources than the minimum-weight decoding algorithms"]}, {"edit": ["These expressions are similar to those obtained in the framework of time-dependent approach in [32], where \\(\\gamma_{0}(\\omega)\\) was arbitrary pulse shape.
