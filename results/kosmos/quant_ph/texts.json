This follows directly from the fact that\n\ndet(*\u03f1*~*AB~) = ^3*p*2^~2~*\u22126*p*2*+8*p*3*\u22126*p*4*+1^~4~*. (3.23)\n\nIt follows from \\[0, 0\\] that *\u03f1*~*AB~ is entangled if and only if det(*\u03f1*~*AB~) &lt; 0. It follows that 3*p*2^~2~*\u2212 6*p*2*+ 8*p*3*\u2212 6*p*4*+ 1 &lt; 0, and equivalently Eq. ( 3.22) holds. This completes the proof.\n\nAccording to Proposition 3.4, we identify the dividing surface represented by *p*~4~ = *F* ( *p*~2~, *p*~3~*)* which separates the whole 3D region of all two-qubit states into two parts corresponding to separable states and entangled states respectively.\n\n**4 Calculating procedure with examples**\n\nAccording to the above discussion, we can list the calculating procedure of *F*+/\u2212 ( *p*~2~, *p*~3~*)* (corresponding to *p*~4~^max\\ /\\ min^) for (*p*~2~, *p*~3~*)* \u2208 *A*.\n\n&gt; **Algorithm 1:** The max/min value of *p*~4~\n&gt;\n&gt; **Input:** (*p*~2~, *p*~3~*)* \u2208 *A*\n&gt;\n&gt; **Output:** *p*~4~^max\\ /\\ min^\n&gt;\n&gt; 1 choose randomly (*p*~2~, *p*~3~*)* \u2208 *A*;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2 calculate *s*~max\\ /\\ min~ \u2261 *s*~max\\ /\\ min~(*p*~2~, *p*~3~*)* via Eqs.

Using the Gram-Schmidt process, we derive the orthogonal vector to \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9 in this plane as\n\n\u2223 \u03c8 \u27e9 = \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8 \u03c8 \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9\u2223 \u03c8 \u27e9 e \u2212 i\u03c6^{\\prime},\\] (C1)\n\nexcept for the case |\u27e8 \u03c8 \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9| = 1, which is trivial since D(\u2223 \u03c8 \u27e9, \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9) is clearly zero. e \u2212 i\u03c6 is a phase that can be chosen arbitrarily, but note that it appears in the parametrization below.\n\nU that connects the two pure states can be expressed as a sum of three terms,\n\n\\[U = \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9\u27e8 \u03c8 \u2223 e i\u03c6 1 + \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9\u27e8 \u03c8 \u27e9\u2223 e i\u03c6 2 + U \u2032,\\\\\\] (C2)\n\nwhere U \u2032 is an arbitrary unitary operator that lives in the irrelevant dimensions orthogonal to \u2223 \u03c8 \u27e9 and \u2223 \u03d5 \u27e9.

      "where \u02c6 K \u00b5 = \u27e8 \u00b5|\\hat{\\mathcal{U}}|a\\rangle. These operators \u02c6 K \u00b5 will form a Kraus representation for the quantum operation E for an open system, Eq. (37), provided the so-called Kraus operators satisfy the extended \u201dunitarity\u201d condition\n\n\\[\\sum_{\u00b5}K^{\\dagger}_{\u00b5}K_{\u00b5}=I \\tag{40}\\]\n\nNote that the individual Kraus operator need not be unitary. Based on this framework for open quantum systems we proceed to construct a physical unitary dilation for the combined systemenvironment by identifying dissipation as an amplitude damping operation, [21] . Let d be the dimension of the system Hilbert space, and r the dimension of the dissipative Hamiltonian H 1 , Eq. (35). We require d \u2265 2 r , for optimal results but the dilation technique can be also applied to systems with d = r . If the system was quantum mechanical in nature, then there can be a set of d 2 Kraus operators at most. The matrix representation of the total unitary dilation evolution operator consists of listing all the Kraus matrices in the first column block. The remaining columns must then be determined so that \u02c6 U is unitary. This unitary dilation is equivalent to the Stinespring dilation theorem [25] . The advantage of the Kraus approach is that it avoids the need to actually know the physical properties of the environment. Returning to the Schrodinger representation of the classical system Eq. (35), one can employ the Trotter-Suzuki expansion to exp [ \u2212 i\u03b4t ( \u02c6 H 0 \u2212 i \u02c6 H 1 )] | \u03c8 ( \u03b4t ) \u27e9 = [e \u2212i\u03b4t \u02c6 H 0 \u00b7 e \u2212\u03b4t \u02c6 H 1 + O(\u03b4t^{2})] | \u03c8 (0) \u27e9 . Even though exp ( \u2212 \u03b4t \u02c6 H 1 ) is not unitary, \u02c6 H 1 is Hermitian and can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation U 1 \u02c6 H 1 = \u02c6 U 1 \u02c6 D 1 \u02c6 U^{\\dagger}_{1} with diagonal \u02c6 D 1 = diag [ \u03b3 1 , ..., \u03b3 r ] , where \u03b3 i > 0 are the dissipative rate eigenvalues of \u02c6 H 1 . Thus Eq. (41) becomes | \u03c8 ( \u03b4t ) \u27e9 = [e \u2212i\u03b4t \u02c6 H 0 \u02c6 U 1 \u02c6 K 0 \u02c6 U^{\\dagger}_{1} + O(\u03b4t^{2})] | \u03c8 (0) \u27e9 , where \u02c6 K 0 is \u02c6 K 0 = [ \u02c6 \u0393 r \u00d7 r 0 r \u00d7 r 0 ( d \u2212 r ) \u00d7 ( d \u2212 r ) \u00d7 ( d \u2212 r ) ] , with diagonal \u02c6\u0393 r \u00d7 r = diag [e \u2212\u03b3 1 \u03b4t ...e \u2212\u03b3 r \u03b4t ] .

When specifically addressing scattering problems, with either classical or quantum simulations, there is an additional conceptual complexity which gets added to the already-serious problem of executing the many-body dynamics: namely, preparing the input state. Initial quantum states in particle colliders experiments typically involve localized wave packets of composite quasiparticles, for example hadrons. Written in the elementary quantum fields, these wave packets have a well defined centerof-mass momentum and overall number density (usually one quasiparticle), but their internal wave function can be very complex. Clearly, the scattering simulation must include strategies to build these states (and control their momentum) by carefully manipulating the elementary quantum fields encoded as qudits, starting from the (entangled) dressed vacuum. Proposals to achieve such input-state preparation have been put forward for Quantum Tensor Network (QTN) [ 84 , 85 ] but the optimal general strategy is still unclear, and requires further investigation. Notice that this problem will remain when it becomes possible to study scattering processes in future quantum processors. Thus, any partial or final solution developed for tensor network will be highly valuable also for future quantum computations and the simulation of scattering processes.

We therefore propose (2+1)D QED as a very suitable benchmark and testbed model to explore the potential of quantum computing and, in particular, to compare it to TN calculations. The most used classical method to study lattice gauge theories numerically nowadays is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, see the recent FLAG review [ 87 ]. While MCMC can reach lattice sizes of order of \\(100^{3}\\times 200\\), which are currently unthinkable for QC and TN techniques, the Hamiltonian formulation used for the latter methods has several advantages. For example, MCMC suffers from very large autocorrelation times towards the continuum limit [ 88 ]. In the regime of small to very small lattice spacing, we can take advantage of quantum computing or tensor network approaches that do not have this drawback. Furthermore, the Euclidean path integral used by MCMC is afflicted by the infamous sign problem [ 5 ] which makes the study of quantum field theories at non-zero fermion densities impossible. More specifically for lattice QCD, this prevents the exploration and characterization of regions of the phase diagram at non-zero baryon density, which are relevant to understand the early universe, neutron stars, or the transition to a quark-gluon plasma. Another important aspect is the limitation for classical MCMC techniques in the presence of a topological term which, in stark contrast, can be treated straightforwardly in the Hamiltonian formulation, i.e. with QC or TN. Finally, a Hamiltonian approach will enable the study of real-time phenomena such as scattering processes, thermalization or the dynamics of physical systems after quenching, see the discussion in Sec.

Let \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) with \\(F(\\psi,\\psi)\\geq 1-\\delta\\) be the input state for this optimal transformation. Then the above argument applied to this transformation proves the claim. \u25a1\n\nAs a final comment, we recall that LOCC N ensemble transformations within an SLOCC class are a subset of SEP 1 ensemble transformations [50] (see Appendix VII A for further details). \u25a0\n\n## IV Approximate transformations\n\nHaving introduced approximate transformations and identified five physically relevant types ( T \u03b4,\u03f5 ens ( \u03c8, \u03c6) etc.), we now set out to better understand these transformations. A complete characterisation of these sets of transformations seems unfeasible. To see this, consider for instance the set T \u03b4,\u03f5 det ( \u03c8, \u03c6). In order to characterise this set, one must characterise all deterministic transformations from any state in the \u03b4-vicinity around \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) to a state in the \u03f5-vicinity around \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\). However, for any finite \u03b4 &gt; 0, there may be an infinite number of SLOCC classes intersecting the \u03b4-vicinity around \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\). Moreover, in the general cases, one must also consider transformations to non-fully-entangled states, which is challenging by itself.\n\nNonetheless, in the coming sections, we will lay out the landscape of approximate transformations. We have seen that, in the bipartite setting, the hierarchy between these transformations collapses as the optimal fidelity is always achievable with a deterministic transformation. In the following, we will show that the multipartite landscape is considerably richer. In Section IV A, we begin by considering the maximally entangled set (MES) under approximate transformations. Then in Section IV B, we consider transformations in which we start exactly with the initial state. That is, we set \u03b4 = 0. Here we start in Section IV B 1 with the simplest approximate transformations, i.e., T 0,\u03f5 ens -SLOCC and T 0,\u03f5 det -SLOCC. We show that, unlike the bipartite case, there are ensemble transformations within an SLOCC class that are better than any deterministic transformation within an SLOCC class (see Fig 2).\n\nFrom here, we move on to study general faithful transformations in Section IV B 2. Here we study how T \u03b4,\u03f5 ens and T \u03b4,\u03f5 det relate to one another.

Therefore, for each given \\(\\epsilon\\), it holds that \\(\\forall\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime}&gt;0\\)\\(\\exists\\chi&gt;0\\) such that \\(|F_{av}(\\Lambda^{\\epsilon,\\chi}(\\psi))-F_{av}(\\Lambda^{\\epsilon}(\\psi),\\phi)|\\leq\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime}\\).\n\nThus, for any \u03b7&gt;0, choose \\(\\epsilon,\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime}&gt;0\\) such that \\(\\epsilon+\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime}\\leq\\eta\\), and then\n\n\\[|F_{ens}(\\psi,\\phi)-F_{av}(\\Lambda^{\\epsilon,\\chi}(\\psi))|\\] \\[\\leq|F_{ens}(\\psi,\\phi)-F_{av}(\\Lambda^{\\epsilon}(\\psi),\\phi)|\\] \\[\\qquad+|F_{av}(\\Lambda^{\\epsilon}(\\psi),\\phi)-F_{av}(\\Lambda^{ \\epsilon,\\chi}(\\psi))|\\] \\[\\leq\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime}+\\epsilon\\leq\\eta, \\tag{37}\\]\n\nwhich proves the result for \u03b4 = 0.\n\nTo extend to the \u03b4 &gt; 0 case, it is sufficient to consider the maximum achievable fidelity from any state within the \u03b4-vicinity. Let \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) with \\(F(\\psi,\\psi)\\geq 1-\\delta\\) be the input state for this optimal transformation. Then the above argument applied to this transformation proves the claim.\n\nAs a final comment, we recall that LOCC N ensemble transformations within an SLOCC class are a subset of SEP 1 ensemble transformations [50] (see Appendix VII A for further details).\n\n## IV Approximate transformations\n\nHaving introduced approximate transformations and identified five physically relevant types ( T \u03b4,\u03f5 ens ( \u03c8, \u03c6) etc.), we now set out to better understand these transformations. A complete characterisation of these sets of transformations seems unfeasible. To see this, consider for instance the set T \u03b4,\u03f5 det ( \u03c8, \u03c6). In order to characterise this set, one must characterise all deterministic transformations from any state in the \u03b4-vicinity around \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) to a state in the \u03f5-vicinity around \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\). However, for any finite \u03b4 &gt; 0, there may be an infinite number of SLOCC classes intersecting the \u03b4-vicinity around \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\). Moreover, in the general cases, one must also consider transformations to non-fully-entangled states, which is challenging by itself.\n\nNonetheless, in the coming sections, we will lay out the landscape of approximate transformations. We have seen that, in the bipartite setting, the hierarchy between these transformations collapses as the optimal fidelity is always achievable with a deterministic transformation. In the following, we will show that the multipartite landscape is considerably richer. In Section IV A, we begin by considering the maximally entangled set (MES) under approximate transformations. Then in Section IV B, we consider transformations in which we start exactly with the initial state. That is, we set \u03b4 = 0. Here we start in Section IV B 1 with the simplest approximate transformations, i.e., T 0,\u03f5 ens -SLOCC and T 0,\u03f5 det -SLOCC. We show that, unlike the bipartite case, there are ensemble transformations within an SLOCC class that are better than any deterministic transformation within an SLOCC class (see Fig 2).\n\nFrom here, we move on to study general faithful transformations in Section IV B 2. Here we study how T \u03b4,\u03f5 ens and T \u03b4,\u03f5 det relate to one another. We show that, unlike the bipartite case, there are cases in the multipartite setting where the optimal approximate transformation is non-deterministic (see Fig. 3). We also present a multipartite example where the optimal faithful transformation is deterministic and extend these results to the setting where \u03b4 &gt; 0, but sufficiently small. In Appendix VII C, we also discuss the limiting case where \u03f5 \u2192 0.\n\nFinally, in Section IV C, we tackle the question of whether there are really significantly more approximate transformations than deterministic transformations; namely, are there approximate transformations which are not in the vicinity of any exact, deterministic transformation?

SYSTEM MODEL Firstly, the basics of quantum communications are discussed and then the model is explained. A. Quantum Basics 1) Quantum States: Quantum bits (qubits) are in a superposition of their orthonormal basis states. A single qubit can be represented as \\(\\ket{\\phi}=\\alpha\\ket{0}+\\beta\\ket{1}\\) where \\(\\ket{\\alpha}^{2}+\\ket{\\beta}^{2}=1\\), \\(\\ket{0}\\) and \\(\\ket{1}\\) are the orthonormal basis states. Similarly, a two-qubit can be represented as \\(\\ket{\\psi}=\\gamma_{1}\\ket{00}+\\gamma_{2}\\ket{01}+\\gamma_{3}\\ket{11}+\\gamma_{4} \\ket{10}\\) where \\(\\ket{\\gamma_{1}}^{2}+\\ket{\\gamma_{2}}^{2}+\\ket{\\gamma_{3}}^{2}+\\ket{\\gamma_{4}}^{2 }=1\\), \\(\\ket{00}\\), \\(\\ket{01}\\), \\(\\ket{11}\\) and \\(\\ket{10}\\) are the orthonormal basis states. Measurement of a qubit leads to the collapse of the qubit to one of its basis states. For example, \\(\\psi\\) when measured will collapse to one of its four orthonormal states with probability \\(\\ket{\\gamma_{x}}^{2}\\), where \\(x=1,2,3,4\\). 2) Quantum Entanglement: A two-qubit system can be in a special state which cannot be expressed as a tensor product of two other states. Lets consider a qubit \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}=\\delta_{1}\\ket{01}+\\delta_{2}\\ket{11}\\). This can be represented as \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}=(\\delta_{1}\\ket{0}+\\delta_{2}\\ket{1})\\otimes\\ket{1}\\) where \\(\\otimes\\) is the tensor product. However, a special two-qubit of the form \\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}=\\delta_{1}\\ket{00}+\\delta_{2}\\ket{11}\\) cannot be represented as a tensor product to two states as \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\). These special states are called entangled states. There are four maximally entangled states also known as Bell pairs or EPR pairs, namely, \\(\\frac{\\ket{00}+\\ket{11}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), \\(\\frac{\\ket{00}-\\ket{11}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), \\(\\frac{\\ket{01}+\\ket{10}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\ket{01}-\\ket{10}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). If the first qubit of the EPR pair is given to one node and the other to the second, and a measurement is performed on the EPR pair then their states are highly deterministic. For example, \\(\\frac{\\ket{01}+\\ket{10}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) with the first node having a value 1 and the other having a value 1, and vice versa "

However, an unambiguous choice can be made for \\(\\mathcal{D}_{t}\\) if we demand a minimal dissipator which corresponds to traceless Lindblad operators [30]. Once the minimal dissipator is determined the corresponding \\(K_{S}\\) defines \\(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}\\). Note, that the minimization does not fix \\(\\beta(t)\\) but, because it is irrelevant for the dynamics, it can be set to zero. The change of internal energy, work and heat is now given by\n\n\\[\\Delta U_{S}(t) = \\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t)\\,\\rho_{S}(t))-\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D} }_{S}(0)\\,\\rho_{S}(0)) \\tag{27}\\] \\[\\delta W_{S}(t) = D_{int}()0^{t}dt^{\\prime}\\,\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\rho_{S}(t^{\\prime}))\\] (28) \\[\\deltaQ_{S}(t) = D_{int}()0^{t}dt^{\\prime}\\,\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\dot{\\rho}_{S}(t^{\\prime}))\\] (29) \\[= D_{int}()0^{t}dt^{\\prime}\\,\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\mathcal{D}_{t}[\\rho_{S}]). \\tag{30}\\]\n\nThe advantage of this identification is that it just depends on the system state \\(\\rho_{S}\\) and could, in general, be applied without knowledge about the environment. In addition, it is based on an extremum principle. However, the useful correspondence between minimal dissipator and traceless Lindblad operators is only established for finite Hilbert spaces. This limitation already causes problems if a single field mode is considered as the system. Even though this can be circumvented by appropriate truncation of the Hilbert space if the dynamics are restricted to a finite subspace, it remains a minor short-coming of an otherwise very convincing approach. **III. APPLICATION TO EXAMPLES**\n\nTo compare these different approaches we study the implications for a simple model and three types of interaction. A two-level system (TLS) or atom is considered as the system of interest and a mode of the radiation field as its environment. This is a standard example in quantum optics and it has been considered in various variations in quantum thermodynamics. It is also frequently encountered as an analogue to a steam engine with a working medium (gas, TLS) coupled to a work depository (piston, field mode) [16, 31].

      "the requirement of Hermiticity and trace preservation follows that the generator can be rewritten as L\\({}_{t}=\\mathcal{H}_{t}+\\mathcal{D}_{t}\\) with a Hamiltonian part \\(\\mathcal{H}_{t}[\\,.\\,]=-i[K_{S}(t),\\,.\\,]\\) and a dissipator with generalized Lindblad structure\n\n\\[\\mathcal{D}_{t}[\\,.\\,]=\\sum_{k}\\gamma_{k}\\left[L_{k},\\,L_{k}^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1 }{2}\\{L_{k}^{\\dagger}L_{k},\\,.\\,\\}\\right] \\tag{24}\\]\n\nwith time dependent rate functions \\(\\{\\gamma_{k}(t)\\}\\) and operators \\(L_{k}(t)\\). This decomposition is not unique, i.e. for each time \\(t\\) the transformation to Lindblad operators and Hamiltonian\n\n\\[L_{k}\\longmapsto L_{k} - \\alpha_{k}\\mathbb{I}_{S} \\tag{25}\\] \\[K_{S}\\longmapsto K_{S} + \\sum_{k}\\frac{\\gamma_{k}}{2i}(\\alpha_{k}L_{k}^{\\dagger}-\\alpha_{k }^{\\star}L_{k})+\\beta\\mathbb{I}_{S} \\tag{26}\\]\n\nwith arbitrary scalar functions \\(\\{\\alpha_{k}(t)\\}\\) and \\(\\beta(t)\\) leaves the generator invariant [21]. However, an unambiguous choice can be made for \\(\\mathcal{D}_{t}\\) if we demand a minimal dissipator which corresponds to traceless Lindblad operators [30].\n\nOnce the minimal dissipator is determined the corresponding \\(K_{S}\\) defines \\(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}\\). Note, that the minimization does not fix \\(\\beta(t)\\) but, because it is irrelevant for the dynamics, it can be set to zero.\n\nThe change of internal energy, work and heat is now given by\n\n\\[\\Delta U_{S}(t) = \\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t)\\,\\rho_{S}(t))-\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D} }_{S}(0)\\,\\rho_{S}(0)) \\tag{27}\\] \\[\\delta W_{S}(t) = D_{int}()0^{t}dt^{\\prime}\\,\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\rho_{S}(t^{\\prime}))\\] (28) \\[\\deltaQ_{S}(t) = D_{int}()0^{t}dt^{\\prime}\\,\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\dot{\\rho}_{S}(t^{\\prime}))\\] (29) \\[= D_{int}()0^{t}dt^{\\prime}\\,\\text{Tr}(H^{\\text{D}}_{S}(t^{\\prime}) \\,\\mathcal{D}_{t}[\\rho_{S}]). \\tag{30}\\]\n\nThe advantage of this identification is that it just depends on the system state \\(\\rho_{S}\\) and could, in general, be applied without knowledge about the environment. In addition, it is based on an extremum principle. However, the useful correspondence between minimal dissipator and traceless Lindblad operators is only established for finite Hilbert spaces. This limitation already causes problems if a single field mode is considered as the system. Even though this can be circumvented by appropriate truncation of the Hilbert space if the dynamics are restricted to a finite subspace, it remains a minor short-coming of an otherwise very convincing approach.\n\n## III Application to examples\n\nTo compare these different approaches we study the implications for a simple model and three types of interaction. A two-level system (TLS) or atom is considered as the system of interest and a mode of the radiation field as its environment.\n\nThis is a standard example in quantum optics and it has been considered in various variations in quantum thermodynamics.

We further introduce the physical strengths \\((d,c)\\) of respectively \\(H_{D}\\) and \\(H_{C}\\) by writing \\(H=dh_{D}+ch_{C}\\) where \\(h_{D}\\) and \\(h_{C}\\) are now dimensionless.

In the case of Anderson localization for example, each site is coupled to R = p sites by tunneling, where p is the coordination of the lattice. In the case of spin dynamics, each microstate is typically coupled to R = O ( N^{2}) microstates (corresponding to spin flips between N(N \u2212 1) /2 pairs of atoms). The left-hand side of Eq. 4 thus qualitatively represents the number of states that are explored by the system, assuming that at each step, there are R times more populated microstates, due to the sole action of \\(H_{C}\\). Note that this estimate is only qualitative, as it for example ignores interference effects that may occur during the propagation in the Hilbert space [35, 36].

We will now make one simplification, in order to find simple qualitative criteria separating localized and chaotic systems. For this, it can be noted that if there is a transition between a localized and a chaotic regime due to a competition between the terms \\(H_{C}\\) and \\(H_{D}\\), the transition will generally occur when these terms are of the same order of magnitude. Therefore \\(\\frac{c^{2}}{d^{2}+c^{2}}\\) is of order unity close to the transition.

Log( R ) will be of order 1 for the Anderson localization, and approximately of order Log( N ) for a generic many-problem.

To conclude, quantum error correction is still in a primitive stage before the potential of quantum computing can be unleashed by fault-tolerant machines. In this sense, surface codes represent the most promising family of codes to be implemented in the early post-NISQ era, principally due to their locality feature (and, in the case of planar instances, two-dimensional qubit placing) and their high tolerance to quantum noise. As extensively reviewed in this article, decoders represent a central part of QEC methods as they are key elements in posing a threshold for a code.

We use this expression to determine the threshold where the eigenvector most localized at the edge starts to shift towards the impurity, by plotting \\(\\lambda^{x_{\\text{imp}}-2}_{B}(E)\\lambda_{\\text{imp}}(E)=1\\). As shown in Fig. 2 (b), this thresh- old aligns with \\(\\min_{n}|\\Psi_{n}(x_{\\text{imp}})|^{2}/|\\Psi_{n}(x_{0})|^{2}=1\\), where the most localized eigenstate is\n\nFigure 2: Breakdown of bulk-edge correspondence in a system with an amplifying non-Hermitian impurity, model Eq.

      "interaction in electron-nuclear spin systems. The observed coherence time T 2 = 0.36(2) s is slightly shorter than the bare nuclear spin-echo time T 2 , SE = 0.62(5) s. This reduction is caused by a perturbitive component of the hyperfine tensor in combination with the finite magnetic field strength (see Supplementary Section V D). Flipping the electron spin between m s = \u00b11 changes the quantization axes of the nuclear spins, which causes a change of the nuclear-nuclear interactions [ ? ], which is not decoupled by the spin-echo sequence (see Extended Data Fig. E4). The effect is strongest for spins near the NV center. For larger fields or for spins with weak hyperfine couplings, we expect that further resolution enhancement is possible by applying multiple refocusing pulses (see Supplementary Section V D). Finally, we combine spin-chain sensing and electronnuclear double resonance to correlate high-resolution spin frequencies ( \u2206 i ) with specific spin-spin couplings ( C ij ), even when a chain contains multiple spins with overlapping frequencies. We illustrate this scheme on a chain of spins, where two spins (2 and 3) have a similar frequency A 23 and both couple to A 1 and A 4 (Fig. 4b). The goal is to extract \u2206 2 , \u2206 3 and the couplings to Spin 4 ( C 24 , C 34 ). As a reference, standard double-resonance shows a quickly decaying time-domain signal, indicating couplings to multiple spins that are spectrally unresolved (Fig. 4b). Figure 4c shows how the electron-nuclear double resonance sequence (mint green) is inserted in the spinchain sequence to perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the A 23 frequency region. Sweeping the interaction time t 1 shows multiple frequencies (Fig. 4d), hinting at the existence of multiple spins with approximately A 23. The result is consistent with two spins at frequencies \u2206 2 = 8019.5(2) Hz and \u2206 3 = 7695.2(1) Hz, split by an internal coupling of C 23 = 7.6(1) Hz (Fig.  4a and Extended Data Fig. E2e,f). Next, we add a nuclear-nuclear block (pink) and sweep both electron-nuclear ( t 1 ) and nuclear-nuclear ( t 2 ) double-resonance times to correlate \u2206 2 and \u2206 3 with nuclear-nuclear couplings C 24 and C 34. The 2D power spectral density (PSD) shows signals in two distinct frequency regions along the f 1-axis, corresponding to \u2206 2 and \u2206 3. Analysing the nuclear-nuclear ( f 2) signal at these frequencies (Fig. 4f), we find C 24 = \u2212 11.8(2) Hz and C 34 = \u2212 0.2(5) Hz. We attribute the splitting to the coupling C 23 between Spins 2 and 3 (Methods, Extended Data Fig.  E2g,h).  Varying RF 4 enables the measurement of the interactions of spins 2 and 3 to other parts of the network (for example to determine C 12 , C 13 ). Beyond the examples shown here, the electron-nuclear block can be inserted at specific positions in the spin-chain sequence (Fig. 2c) to extract \u2206 i of all spins in the chain (Supplementary Fig. S5).\n\nn### Reconstruction of a 50 spin network\n\nFinally, we apply these methods to map a 50-spin network. The problem resembles a graph search (Methods) [ ? ]. By identifying a number of spin chains in the system, and fusing them together based on overlapping sections, we reconstruct the connectivity (Fig. 5). Limited sized chains are sufficient because the couplings are\n\nFigure 3: Electron-nuclear double resonance. a) The nuclear-spin frequencies A i are shifted by the hyperfine interaction with the electron spin \u2206 i (blue dotted line).

We illustrate this scheme on a chain of spins, where two spins (2 and 3) have a similar frequency A 23 and both couple to A 1 and A 4 (Fig. 4a). The goal is to extract \u2206 2 , \u2206 3 and the couplings to Spin 4 ( C 24 , C 34 ). As a reference, standard double-resonance shows a quickly decaying time-domain signal, indicating couplings to multiple spins that are spectrally unresolved (Fig. 4b).\n\nFigure 4c shows how the electron-nuclear double resonance sequence (mint green) is inserted in the spin-chain sequence to perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the A 23 frequency region. Sweeping the interaction time t 1 shows multiple frequencies (Fig. 4d), hinting at the existence of multiple spins with approximately A 23. The result is consistent with two spins at frequencies \u2206 2 = 8019.5(2) Hz and \u2206 3 = 7695.2(1) Hz, split by an internal coupling of C 23 = 7.6(1) Hz (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. E2e,f).\n\nNext, we add a nuclear-nuclear block (pink) and sweep both electron-nuclear ( t 1 ) and nuclear-nuclear ( t 2 ) double-resonance times to correlate \u2206 2 and \u2206 3 with nuclear-nuclear couplings C 24 and C 34. The 2D power spectral density (PSD) shows signals in two distinct frequency regions along the f 1 -axis, corresponding to \u2206 2 and \u2206 3. Analysing the nuclear-nuclear ( f 2 ) signal at these frequencies (Fig. 4f), we find C 24 = \u2212 11.8(2) Hz and C 34 = \u2212 0.2(5) Hz. We attribute the splitting to the coupling C 23 between Spins 2 and 3 (Methods, Extended Data Fig. E2g,h). Varying RF 4 enables the measurement of the interactions of spins 2 and 3 to other parts of the network (for example to determine C 12 , C 13 ). Beyond the examples shown here, the electron-nuclear block can be inserted at specific positions in the spin-chain sequence (Fig. 2c) to extract \u2206 i of all spins in the chain (Supplementary Fig. S5).\n\n### Reconstruction of a 50 spin network\n\nFinally, we apply these methods to map a 50-spin network. The problem resembles a graph search (Methods) [ ? ]. By identifying a number of spin chains in the system, and fusing them together based on overlapping sections, we reconstruct the connectivity (Fig. 5). Limited sized chains are sufficient because the couplings are\n\nFigure 3: Electron-nuclear double resonance. a) The nuclear-spin frequencies A i are shifted by the hyperfine interaction with the electron spin \u2206 i (blue dotted line). Performing double resonance between the nuclear spin and the electron (mint green) retains this interaction while decoupling from quasi-static noise. b) Pulse sequence for measuring \u2206 1 for a spin at \u2248 A 1. The nuclear spin undergoes a spin echo, while the electron population is transferred from the |\u22121\u27e9 to the |+1\u27e9 state (shaded green). c) Zoom-in of spectroscopy data as in Fig. 2d, showing a broad resonance (63 Hz FWHM), limited by the nuclear T 2 -time. d) Time domain signal of \u2206 1 = 14549.91(5) Hz (undersampled), with a coherence time of 0.36(2) s, fitted by a sinusoid with Gaussian decay\n\n"

The quest for effective approaches to achieve on-chip frequency conversion and generate photon pairs has been an enduring endeavor. Over the last decades, various nanophotonic platforms have been proposed to implement and enhance nonlinear photon generation processes, including wire waveguides,, nanobeam cavities,, metamaterials,, microring resonators,, periodically poled waveguides/cavities,, and photonic crystal cavities.. It is well-known that high-quality factor cavities designed at target frequencies can bolster the nonlinear process by enhancing the field with confinement. Yet, the effective phase matching conditions are typically challenging to satisfy in non-conventional cavity structures. Without effective phase-matching, the generated photons from different positions in nonlinear materials can destructively interfere, reducing the total generation efficiency. Such issues can be addressed by computational inverse design.. Recently, the adjoint method has been generalized to optimize nonlinear photonic processes, such as second harmonic generation or optical switches based on the Kerr effect.. However, current optimization methods face difficulties in generalization to multi-photon generation processes, and the coupling efficiencies for both input and output channels are often overlooked due to the optimization complexity. In addition, an intuitive understanding of the inverse-designed structure is unclear. The optimized structure often lacks interpretability, making it challenging to gain insights into how and why the in- verse design method works.\n\nTo address these challenges, we put forth an inverse design approach to amplify the efficiency of on-chip photon pair generation. We implement this strategy using the open-source package EmOpt.. Our method employs a multi-frequency co-optimization strategy and calculates gradients with respect to the design parameters via the adjoint method. The resulting efficiency enhancement stems not only from the increased field intensity due to the confinement of light in high quality factor cavity resonances but also from the improvement of phase-matching conditions, along with coupling between the cavity and waveguide mode considered in the design. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by fabricating and characterizing an optimized device that enables the efficient generation of photon pairs. Interestingly, the shape of the proposed design can also be explained by an effective potential method, and the approximate solution aligns well with the finite-difference frequency domain (FDFD) simulation results. The proposed optimization strategy can be generalized to other nonlinear processes for compact frequency-mixing devices on-chip, and the performance can be further improved using global optimization methods..\n\n## Method and proposed device\n\nThe proposed multi-frequency co-optimization strategy and calculates gradients with respect to the design parameters via the adjoint method.

This full simulation agrees very well with the experimental data (see Fig. 4) and suggests improving the coherence of the correlated spin-exchange dynamics in future studies.\n\n**Conclusions and outlook**\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a new approach to constructing the Heisenberg-type spin model in a Rydberg atom array. Di\ufb00erent from previous schemes realized by dipolar exchange interaction and Floquet engineering [22], our approach is based on Rydberg dressing of an Ising Hamiltonian, which can o\ufb00er a large and widely tunable anisotropy. In the current experiment, we focused on the single-magnon and the two-magnon sector. By creating more excitations in a large-scale array, the system may allow exploration of emergent Hilbert space fragmentation [39] and the Krylov-restricted thermalization of multiple magnons [9]. The scheme also allows dynamical engineering of spin transport, topological pumping protocols and programmable entanglement distributions [8].

This full simulation agrees very well with the experimental data (see Fig. 4) and suggests improving the coherence of the correlated spin-exchange dynamics in future studies.\n\n**Conclusions and outlook**\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a new approach to constructing the Heisenberg-type spin model in a Rydberg atom array. Di\ufb00erent from previous schemes realized by dipolar exchange interaction and Floquet engineering [22], our approach is based on Rydberg dressing of an Ising Hamiltonian, which can o\ufb00er a large and widely tunable anisotropy. In the current experiment, we focused on the single-magnon and the two-magnon sector. By creating more excitations in a large-scale array, the system may allow exploration of emergent Hilbert space fragmentation [39] and the Krylov-restricted thermalization of multiple magnons [9]. The scheme also allows dynamical engineering of spin transport, topological pumping protocols and programmable entanglement distributions [8]. Generalizations to higher dimension could lead to richer physics. In particular, in a 2D lattice, the inclusion of a multicolor dressing field could enable application of a synthetic gauge flux [41], which can give rise to topologically protected chiral motion of the magnonbound state and holds promise for observation of a chiral spin liquid [42].\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**\n\nThis research was supported by Samsung Science and Technology Foundation (SSTF-BA1301-52) and National Research Foundation of Korea (2017R1E1A1A01074307).

In this regime, the operator dynamics of the Trotterized circuit can hence be expected to remain close to the operator dynamics of the original Hamiltonian. However, this regime cannot persist for arbitrarily large values of \\(n\\).

This structure of the Krylov matrix is identical to the structure previously observed in dual-unitary circuits in Eq. ( 31 ), indicating that in each step the Heisenberg evolution with \\(U\\) creates a new operator that is linearly independent from all previously generated operators in the Krylov subspace. In this regime the operator dynamics in the unitary circuit is qualitatively different from that of the Hamiltonian system. As one example, we can again consider the autocorrelation function for a Krylov operator \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\). In the circuit case, the autocorrelation identically vanishes after a single discrete time step (up to exponentially small corrections), same as in dual-unitary circuits, which is prohibited in the Hamiltonian case. Here we can also contrast the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation function, since in the Hamiltonian case the autocorrelation function is expected to reach a nonzero thermal value constrained by conservation of energy, again to be contrasted with the vanishing autocorrelation function in the unitary circuit. Crossover regimeThe remaining question is about the origin of the transition scale and the collapse observed when recscaling \\(n\\) with \\(\\Delta t^{\\delta}\\). As it turns out, this scale is very closely related to the size of the operator and operator spreading. We expect a transition in the behaviour of the circuit once an operator \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) acts non-trivially on around \\(\\ell\\sim 1/\\Delta t\\) sites. While the full support of both \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) and \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) grows linearly in \\(n\\), the bulk of the operator typically acts on a smaller number of sites, as quantified in, e.g., out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) and operator spreading [ 16 \u2013 18 ]. While the support of \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) is by now well understood through studies in, e.g., random unitary circuits, these results do not directly translate to the support of \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\). We quantify the operator growth in the usual way, considering\n\n\\[\\text{OTOC}(n,j)=\\text{Tr}\\left[\\mathcal{O}_{n}^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{j}^{\\gamma} \\mathcal{O}_{n}\\sigma_{j}^{\\gamma}\\right]/\\mathcal{D}\\,, \\tag{52}\\]\n\nwith \\(\\gamma\\in\\{x,y,z\\}\\). We observe that this profile resembles an error function, as also expected for \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\), and define \\(\\ell\\) as the value of \\(n\\) where the error function equals \\(1/2\\).

In this regime the operator dynamics in the unitary circuit is qualitatively different from that of the Hamiltonian system. As one example, we can again consider the autocorrelation function for a Krylov operator \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\). In the circuit case, the autocorrelation identically vanishes after a single discrete time step (up to exponentially small corrections), same as in dual-unitary circuits, which is prohibited in the Hamiltonian case. Here we can also contrast the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation function, since in the Hamiltonian case the autocorrelation function is expected to reach a nonzero thermal value constrained by conservation of energy, again to be contrasted with the vanishing autocorrelation function in the unitary circuit.\n\nCrossover regime. The remaining question is about the origin of the transition scale and the collapse observed when rec-scaling \\(n\\) with \\(\\Delta t^{g}\\). As it turns out, this scale is very closely related to the size of the operator and operator spreading. We expect a transition in the behaviour of the circuit once an operator \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) acts non-trivially on around \\(\\ell\\sim 1/\\Delta t\\) sites. While the full support of both \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) and \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) grows linearly in \\(n\\), the bulk of the operator typically acts on a smaller number of sites, as quantified in, e.g., out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) and operator spreading [ 16, 17, 18]. While the support of \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\) is by now well understood through studies in, e.g., random unitary circuits, these results do not directly translate to the support of \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\). We quantify the operator growth in the usual way, considering\n\n\\[\\text{OTOC}(n,j)=\\text{Tr}\\left[\\mathcal{O}_{n}^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{j}^{\\gamma} \\mathcal{O}_{n}\\sigma_{j}^{\\gamma}\\right]/\\mathcal{D}\\,, \\tag{52}\\]\n\nwith \\(\\gamma\\in\\{x,y,z\\}\\). We observe that this profile resembles an error function, as also expected for \\(|\\mathcal{O}_{n})\\), and define \\(\\ell\\) as the value of \\(n\\) where the error function equals \\(1/2\\).

Specifically, the Rabi Hamiltonian, [44, 45, 46, 47]\n\n\\[H^{\\rm Rabi}_{\\rm L=R,R}=\\frac{F_{i}}{2}\\cos(\\Omega_{i}t+\\Phi_{i})\\sigma^{i}_{ z}+\\omega_{i}a^{\\dagger}_{i}a_{i}-g_{i}(a^{\\dagger}_{i}+a_{i})\\sigma^{i}_{x}, \\tag{2}\\]\n\npresents a driven qubit coupled to a photon mode at frequency \\(\\omega_{i}\\) with a strength of \\(g_{i}\\) in the \\(i\\)th (i = L, R) resonator. The external harmonic driving field imposed to the \\(i\\)th qubit is characterized by an amplitude \\(F_{i}\\), a frequency \\(\\Omega_{i}\\) and an initial phase \\(\\Phi_{i}\\). Here \\(\\sigma^{i}_{x}\\) and \\(\\sigma^{i}_{z}\\) are Pauli matrices and \\(a_{i}\\) (a^{\\dagger}_{i}\\)) is the annihilation (creation) operator of the \\(i\\)th photon mode. Throughout this work, it is assumed that the two photon modes have the same frequencies \\(\\omega_{\\rm L}=\\omega_{\\rm R}=\\omega_{r}\\), and the qubit-photon coupling strengths in two resonators are also the same, \\(g_{\\rm L}=g_{\\rm R}=g\\).\n\nThe micromechanical resonator is modelled by a single phonon mode\n\n\\[H_{\\rm ph}=\\omega_{\\rm ph}b^{\\dagger}b \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwith a frequency of \\(\\omega_{\\rm ph}\\) and a creation (annihilation) operator \\(b^{\\dagger}\\) ( b ). The interaction between the micromechanical resonator and the two qubits is then expressed as\n\n\\[H_{\\rm ph-q}=\\alpha(b^{\\dagger}+b)(\\sigma^{\\rm L}_{z}+\\sigma^{\\rm R}_{z}), \\tag{4}\\]\n\nwhere \u03b1 stands for the qubit-phonon coupling strength.

Thereafter, low frequency phonons and qubit-phonon coupling will be introduced to the Rabi Dimer system to emulate environmental effects in the Rabi dimer system.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows Sec. II we present our methodology, including the system Hamiltonian, the Multi D\\({}_{2}\\) *Ansatz*, and the time-dependent variational principle. In Sec. III, results and discussions will be given. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sec. IV.\n\n## II Methodology\n\n### Hamiltonian of the hybrid QED device\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the hybrid circuit QED system explored in the current work comprises of two coupled transmission-line resonators each interacting with a qubit, and the qubits are modulated via external driving fields and coupled to a micromechanical resonator. The two transmission-line resonators coupled with qubits are modelled by a Rabi dimer Hamiltonian (\u210f = 1)\n\n\\[H_{\\rm RD}=H^{\\rm Rabi}_{\\rm L}+H^{\\rm Rabi}_{\\rm R}-J(a^{\\dagger}_{\\rm L}a_{ \\rm R}+a^{\\dagger}_{\\rm R}a_{\\rm L}), \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(H^{\\rm Rabi}_{\\rm L/R}\\) is a Rabi Hamiltonian describing the left (L) or right (R) resonator coupled to a qubit, and \\(J\\) refers to the tunnelling rate for photons hopping between the two resonators. Specifically, the Rabi Hamiltonian, [44, 45, 46, 47]\n\n\\[H^{\\rm Rabi}_{\\rm L=R,R}=\\frac{F_{i}}{2}\\cos(\\Omega_{i}t+\\Phi_{i})\\sigma^{i}_{ z}+\\omega_{i}a^{\\dagger}_{i}a_{i}-g_{i}(a^{\\dagger}_{i}+a_{i})\\sigma^{i}_{x}, \\tag{2}\\]\n\npresents a driven qubit coupled to a photon mode at frequency \\(\\omega_{i}\\) with a strength of \\(g_{i}\\) in the \\(i\\)th (i = L, R) resonator. The external harmonic driving field imposed to the \\(i\\)th qubit is characterized by an amplitude \\(F_{i}\\), a frequency \\(\\Omega_{i}\\) and an initial phase \\(\\Phi_{i}\\). Here \\(\\sigma^{i}_{x}\\) and \\(\\sigma^{i}_{z}\\) are Pauli matrices and \\(a_{i}\\) (a^{\\dagger}_{i}\\)) is the annihilation (creation) operator of the \\(i\\)th photon mode. Throughout this work, it is assumed that the two photon modes have the same frequencies \\(\\omega_{\\rm L}=\\omega_{\\rm R}=\\omega_{r}\\), and the qubit-photon coupling strengths in two resonators are also the same, \\(g_{\\rm L}=g_{\\rm R}=g\\).\n\nThe micromechanical resonator is modelled by a single phonon mode\n\n\\[H_{\\rm ph}=\\omega_{\\rm ph}b^{\\dagger}b \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwith a frequency of \\(\\omega_{\\rm ph}\\) and a creation (annihilation) operator \\(b^{\\dagger}\\) ( b ). The interaction between the micromechanical resonator and the two qubits is then expressed as\n\n\\[H_{\\rm ph-q}=\\alpha(b^{\\dagger}+b)(\\sigma^{\\rm L}_{z}+\\sigma^{\\rm R}_{z}), \\tag{4}\\]\n\nwhere \u03b1 stands for the qubit-phonon coupling strength. Combining the Hamiltonians for the Rabi dimer, the phonon mode, and the qubit-phonon interaction yields the total Hamiltonian for the hybrid system\n\n\\[H=H_{\\rm RD}+H_{\\rm ph}+H_{\\rm q-ph}. \\tag{5}\\]\n\nConsidering the low working temperatures of the modelled QED device, the micromechanical resonator in the system is thermally inactive and thus the temperature is set to zero in this work. Nevertheless, we still would like to comment that quantum "

The linear prediction coefficients are solved as d k = (M \u22121 jk \u03d5 j )\u2217 . Once we obtain d j , we can estimate subsequent function values with Eq. (1). C. Discussion on performance Linear prediction exhibits excellent performance on periodic analytic functions, particularly plane waves and sinusoidal functions [16]. For instance, when considering the plane wave function f ( x ) = e ikx , it can be analytically justified that linear prediction with a single coefficient (order 1) yields perfect estimation. In this case, the coefficient d represents a constant phase e ik \u25b3 x , where \u25b3 x is the spacing between x i values. Multiplying d with f ( x ) produces the same result as evaluating f ( x + \u25b3 x ) . This conclusion can be extended to sums of plane waves with different frequencies. Each additional frequency necessitates an extra prediction coefficient to achieve perfect estimation. Fig. 1 illustrates linear prediction results for plane wave functions with varying frequencies, serving as examples. The extrapolation starts at the black vertical line, with the input function values for the algorithm shown in blue, and the output estimation results depicted in red. The figures only display the real part of the complex function values. However, linear prediction\u2019s performance diminishes for non-analytic periodic functions [17] such as square\nFigure 1: Estimation results of plane wave functions with linear prediction.

For a complex array y 1 ,...,y n with y i \u2208 C, the squared error is given by:\n\n\\[S = \\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}|y_{i}-\\sum_{j=1}^{m}y_{i-j}d_{j}|^{2}\\] \\[= \\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}|y_{i}|^{2}-\\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(y_{i}^ {*}y_{i-j}d_{j}-y_{i}y_{i-j}^{*}d_{j}^{*})\\] \\[+ \\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\sum_{k=1}^{m}y_{i-j}y_{i-k}^{*}d_{ j}d_{k}^{*}.\\]\n\nTo minimize the sum of squared errors, we set the partial derivative of S with respect to d j to 0:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial d_{j}} = -\\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}y_{i}^{*}y_{i-j}+\\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{m}y _{i-j}y_{i-k}^{*}d_{k}^{*}=0\\ . \\tag{3}\\]\n\nWe can express Eq.

(1).\n\n### Discussion on performance\n\nLinear prediction exhibits excellent performance on periodic analytic functions, particularly plane waves and sinusoidal functions [16]. For instance, when considering the plane wave function f ( x ) = e ikx , it can be analytically justified that linear prediction with a single coefficient (order 1) yields perfect estimation. In this case, the coefficient d represents a constant phase e ik \u25b3 x , where \u25b3 x is the spacing between x i values. Multiplying d with f ( x ) produces the same result as evaluating f ( x + \u25b3 x ).\n\nThis conclusion can be extended to sums of plane waves with different frequencies. Each additional frequency necessitates an extra prediction coefficient to achieve perfect estimation. Fig. 1 illustrates linear prediction results for plane wave functions with varying frequencies, serving as examples. The extrapolation starts at the black vertical line, with the input function values for the algorithm shown in blue, and the output estimation results depicted in red. The figures only display the real part of the complex function values.\n\nHowever, linear prediction's performance diminishes for non-analytic periodic functions [17] such as square\n\nFigure 1: Estimation results of plane wave functions with linear prediction. (a). f ( x ) = e ix estimated with m = 1. (b). f ( x ) = e ix + e 2 ix estimated with m = 2. (c). f ( x ) = cos x + cos \u221a 2 x estimated with m = 4.\n\n "

      "Quantum hacking against discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution using modified local oscillator intensity attack with random fluctuations\n\nLu Fan, Yiming Bian, Mingze Wu, Yichen Zhang, and Song Yu\n\nzhangyc@bupt.edu.cn State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China\n\nOctober 15, 2023\n\n###### Abstract\n\nThe local oscillator in practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution system fluctuates at any time during the key distribution process, which may open security loopholes for the eavesdropper to hide her eavesdropping behaviors. Based on this, we investigate a more stealthy quantum attack where the eavesdroppers simulates random fluctuations of local oscillator intensity in a practical discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system. Theoretical simulations show that both communicating parties will misestimate channel parameters and overestimate the secret key rate due to the modified attack model, even though they have monitored the mean local oscillator intensity and shot-noise as commonly used. Specifically, the eavesdropper\u2019s manipulation of random fluctuations in LO intensity disturbs the parameter estimation in realistic discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system, where the experimental parameters are always used for constraints of the semidefinite program modeling. The modified attack introduced by random fluctuations of local oscillator can only be eliminated by monitoring the local oscillator intensity in real time which places a higher demand on the accuracy of monitoring technology. Moreover, similar quantum hacking will also occur in practical local local oscillator system by manipulating the random fluctuations in pilot intensity, which shows the strong adaptability and the important role of the proposed attack.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nQuantum key distribution (QKD) [ 1 ] relies on quantum mechanical properties to ensure communication security, which allows two remote parties to generate unconditionally secure keys despite the presence of potential eavesdroppers in quantum channels [ 2 , 3 ]. Depending on the dimension of coding, it can be divided into discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) and continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) [ 4 , 5 ]. Between them, CV-QKD uses coherent detection technology to replace single-photon detection technology, which can be well compatible with classical optical communication systems [ 6 ]. In addition, the transmission distance achieved recently can support the requirement in metropolitan distances [ 7 \u2013 9 ] which facilitates the large-scale application of QKD [ 10 ? ? \u2013 14 ].\n\nCV-QKD based on Gaussian-modulation (GM) [ 15 \u2013 25 ] is widely used, where the quadratures of quantum states are modulated according to the Gaussian probability distribution. Moreover, discrete-modulated (DM) CV-QKD [ 26 ], where the quadratures of quantum states are modulated discretely, has also been gaining a lot of attention. Due to the simplicity of state preparation [ 9 , 27 , 28 ] and lower complexity of classical error correction [ 29 , 30 ], the unconditional security of DM CV-QKD protocols (e.g.two-state and three-state protocols [ 31 , 32 ]) has been successively proved. Recently, one of its security analysis theory is using the semidefinite program (SDP) model to give the lower bound of the secret key rate [ 33 \u2013 37 ], and related experiments have also been carried out [ 9 , 29 , 38 ]. With the tremendous progress in theory and experiment of DM CV-QKD in recent years, its practical system security has received increasing attention. Different from theoretical analysis, the transmission of the local oscillator in the practical DM CV-QKD system would leave Eve with vulnerabilities to perform quantum hacking.\n\nThe local oscillator (LO) is required for stable coherent detection, whose non-ideality within practical environments is usually ignored in the security analysis of CV-QKD. Due to the imperfection of practical blocks and devices, researchers have proposed many quantum hacking models aiming at practical LO, such as local oscillator calibration attack [ 39 ], local oscillator intensity fluctuation attack [ 40 ], wavelength attacks [ 41 , 42 ], polarization attack [ 43 ] and so on.

The effect of the oscillator bath is completely determined by the spectral function J(\u03c9), which in the ohmic case is given by\n\n\\[J(\\omega)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sum_{i}c_{i}^{2}\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_{i}) \\tag{50}\\]\n\nwith \\(c_{i}\\sim g_{i}\\omega_{i}\\). For the simplicity of the discussion, we consider simulating the spin dynamics of a spin-boson model with one spin and three bosons, and set \\(\\omega=2\\), \\(\\varepsilon=2\\) and \\(\\Delta=1\\).

We demonstrate an equivalent quantum-inspired (classical) version of it in the next section, Section 4 . In the Section 3.1 next, we define the method to convert the classical data into quantum states. In what follows, we describe how these states are manipulated so that we obtain an output that can be used to perform clustering. In Section 2.3 , we show how the circuit of Section 2.3 can be used for dissimilarity estimation. Section 3.2 defines the quantum algorithm in terms of Definitions 1 to 3, and Section 3.3 discusses the complexity and scalability of the algorithm. *3.1. Stereographic Embedding, Bloch Embedding and Quantum Dissimilarity For quantum algorithms to work on classical data, the classical data must be converted into quantum states. This process of encoding classical data into quantum states is also called embedding. The process of data embedding is an active field of research, more details on existing embedding can be found in Appendix B . Here, we propose the stereographic embedding as an improved embedding of classical vector* \ud835\udc29 *in R^2 into quantum state using the stereographic projection. We can split stereographic embedding into two steps: inverse stereographic projection and Bloch embedding. We define Bloch embedding, a variation of angle embedding, as follows. **Definition 7.** *\\[Bloch embedding\\] Let* \ud835\udc0f *in R^3. We define the Bloch embedded quantum state, or Bloch embedding for short, of* \ud835\udc0f *as the quantum state* \ud835\udf13\ud835\udc0f *: = 1 2 (\ud835\udfcf + \ud835\udc0f *\u2225\ud835\udc0f\u2225) \u22c5 \ud835\udf0e which is simply the pure state obtained using* \ud835\udc0f */ \u2225\ud835\udc0f\u2225 as Bloch vector.

The training process involved 100,000 episodes, and a replay memory was used with a length matching the number of warmup steps. Mini-batch training was performed with a batch size of 32, and the Q-network was updated using 2,000 steps of data collected during each episode.

For both panels, the initial condition x 0 = 2^n-1. The x axes show \u00b5, controlling the logistic map and its truncated version. The y axes show iterate values f(x)/2^n so they lie within the unit interval. For both figures the initial condition is given by x 0 = 2^n-1. The orbits of the logistic map are insensitive to the initial condition (excepting a small set which includes the initial condition x = 0). For \u00b5 &lt; 1 all orbits approach x = 0. For 1 &lt; \u00b5 &lt; 3 there is a single attracting fixed point. At \u00b5 = 3 there is a bifurcation giving an attracting period 2 orbit for 3.0 &lt; \u00b5 \u2272 3.45. Subsequent bifurcations show the phenomenon known as _period doubling_. Despite a low number of qubits, the structure of the logistic map is present in the iterates shown in Figure 1, of the truncated function of equation 5. In Figure 2a for \u00b5 near but below 3, the distributions of iterates is wider than at lower values of \u00b5. For each value of \u00b5, the iterates are close together but cycle between nearby values. When an orbit is periodic, we refer to it as a cycle. Maps can have computationally determined periods that are dependent on the precision of the arithmetic [9, 16]. We see this phenomenon here as iterates in the truncated map can cycle between nearby states for the same value of \u00b5 giving iterates in the original map that approach a fixed point. For the logistic map, if \u00b5 gives a periodic attractor, orbits from almost all initial conditions converge on to it. However, for the truncated map, at a given \u00b5, almost all initial conditions will give orbits that enter periodic cycles with the same period, however the points in these different cycles may not all be identical. The sensitivity to initial condition of the period p of a cycle that an orbit enters is illustrated in more detail in Figure 3. We compute iterates of the oracle function (the orbits) for different values of initial condition x 0 and control variable \u00b5. All orbits eventually enter a periodic cycle. The index of the iteration where the cycle is entered we call k c. This number is referred to as the _link length_ by [16] and defined as\n\n\\[k_{c}(x_{0})=\\min\\{k|f^{k}(x_{0})=f^{k+p}(x_{0})\\text{ for }k\\geq 0\\}. \\tag{7}\\]\n\nwhere p is the period of the cycle that is entered. The median period of the cycle for different initial conditions is shown as a function of \u00b5 in the top panels in Figure 3. The period of the cycle that an orbit enters is shown as an image and as a function of \u00b5 (on the x-axis) and initial condition x 0 on the y-axis in the second panels. In the third panels we plot the iterates after the cycle has been entered and with color set by the cycle period. The link length, or iteration number when the cycle is entered, k c is shown as an image in the bottom panels. Due to truncation, the attracting orbits of f either remain in a single state or are periodic, even for values of \u00b5 that would give chaotic orbits in the logistic map. For values of \u00b5 that give chaotic orbits in the logistic map, the truncated map f could have a long period, with period sensitive to the truncation level, which is set by the number of qubits in the quantum registers.

      "from what Einstein\u2019s General Relativity predicts. This signature squeezes classical-quantum theories of gravity from both sides: if one has shorter decoherence times for superpositions of different mass distributions, one necessarily has more diffusion of the gravitational metric. One can thus use Cavendish-type experiments to upper bound the amount of diffusion, and coherence experiments to lower bound it, thus squeezing the parameter space of the theory from both sides. The decoherence-diffusion trade-off, therefore, provides a way of testing CQ theories: one lower bounds the amount of diffusion the theory must have from coherence experiments, which can then be tested by measuring the noise in precision mass experiments. The present work aims to study the weak field limit of classical-quantum theories of general relativity and to provide a series of kernels that characterise correlations in the stochastic dynamics. From these, theorists and experimentalists can choose to develop and test the parameter space of CQ theories. In the main body, we do so in two different ways. We construct the Newtonian limit of both the path CQ general relativistic path integral of [ 33 ] and of the master equation from [ 22 ]. The master equation is then unraveled in the form of coupled Langevin stochastic differential equations for the classical gravitational field and the quantum state of matter. In order to do so, we first identify the relevant degree of freedom as being the Newtonian potential in a non-relativistic setting. To corroborate our results, in [ 37 ], we verify our approach by comparing it to a diffeomorphism invariant CQ theory of scalar gravity, which gives the correct Newtonian limit. If such theories are in violation of experiments, this will provide an indirect test for the quantum nature of gravity. In [ 35 ], the decoherence diffusion trade-off was used to rule out a large class of natural theories that we derive here, namely those which are ultra-local, nonrelativistic and continuous in the classical phase space. Hence, an important problem is to study and classify consistent classical-quantum theories of gravity, and their low energy limit, in order to further squeeze the parameter space of physically sensible CQ theories. Moving away from fundamentally classical fields, we also mention that CQ theories of gravity could describe an effective regime of quantum gravity whenever the gravitational field freedom behaves classically. In this case, we expect that variants of the master equation and path integral we find here will be useful in describing this limit. However, an effective theory will be non-Markovian in some regimes, meaning that the decoherence-diffusion trade-off will not need to hold for all times [ 22 ]. Lastly, given that we are discussing a semiclassical model of Newtonian gravity, in the discussion we compare and contrast our results with those of [ 26 \u2013 28 , 38 , 39 ].

Correlating polarization with the light\u2019s spatial or spectral shape results in so-called spatial or spectral vector beams that are fully polarized and have a spatially or spectrally varying polarization structure. Here, we extend the general idea of vector beams by combining both approaches and structuring a novel state of light in three non-separable DoF\u2019s, i.e. space, wavelength, and polarization. We study in detail their complex polarization structure, show that the degree of polarization of the field is only unveiled when the field is narrowly defined in space and wavelength, and demonstrate the analogy to the loss of coherence in non-separable quantum systems. Such light fields allow fundamental studies on the non-separable nature of a classical light field and new technological opportunities, e.g. through applications in imaging or spectroscopy.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nIncreasing the complexity of a light field and the control of different degrees of freedom (DoF's) is beneficial for advancing research and technology. Increasingly complex structures realized by combining several DoF's have been studied in a myriad of experiments over the last decades and the enhanced understanding of the interplay of the DoF's has already enabled novel photonic technologies [1 \u2013 6 ]. Initially, many experiments have studied structuring transverse light fields as well as shaping the temporal profile of pulses, both in its scalar forms, i.e. with a uniform polarization structure [7 , 8 ]. The complexity of the light field's structure was further increased by including the polarization domain leading to beams with spatially non-uniform polarization distributions, i.e. spatial vector beams, as well as a temporally varying polarization vector across the pulse duration. Over the last years, this approach has been extended to combine all DoF's, e.g. the study of advanced spatio-temporal pulses of vectorial light fields [9 ]. Interestingly, the focus in most of the research efforts has been to generate complex polarization and spatial patterns over the temporal domain of light with much less attention to studying structured light fields in the time's complementary DoF, i.e. the spectral domain. Correlating polarization with the wavelength of a light pulse, for example, can be used for advanced sensing and pulse characterization schemes [10 \u2013 14 ].\n\nHere, we extend the idea of spatial and spectral vector beams by combining all three DoF's, namely polarization, space, and wavelength of the light field. We term such light pulses spatio-spectral vector beams (SSVB's), which are light fields with a varying polarization structure in space as well as wavelength as shown in Fig. 1 a). Using a simple setup consisting of only three optical elements placed along a single beam line, we are able to generate highly complex pulses of light for which any given wavelength (or transverse angular position) the light field shows a different spatial (or spectral) polarization pattern. We further show that all three DoF's are non-separable and the complex vectorial nature of the light field can only be observed when all DoF's are resolved. By integrating over the light's transverse spatial extend or wavelength spectrum (or both), the beam would be seemingly unpolarized. Finally, we detail the analogy of such complex structured light fields to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which describes three entangled particles in quantum optics. Here, the DoF's of the classical light field act as the different quantum states in the GHZ description. We expect that the complexity of SSVB's combined with the ease of our generation technique will trigger novel studies on structured light fields and advance their applications in novel spectroscopy, imaging, or sensing technologies.\n\nFigure 1: Conceptual idea.

At each time \\(t\\), we have input channel(s) \\(S(t)\\) (for stimulus) and output channel(s) \\(R(t)\\) (for response) \\([0]\\). To describe how the computing machine \\(M\\) works, we need to specify the outputs as a function of the inputs. Since the transmission of signals requires some time, the output must be at a time later than the time of the input channel. We assume the machine response \\(R(r+1)\\) because of \\(S(t)\\) to depend on the state of the machine \\(Q(t)\\) \\([0]\\)\n\n\\[R(t+1)=F(Q(t),S(t)) \\tag{61}\\]\n\nand the state of the machine \\(M\\) depend on the stimulus \\(S(t)\\) and the state of the machine at previous time,\n\n\\[Q(t+1)=G(Q(t),S(t)). \\tag{62}\\]\n\n### Memristive systems\n\nThe memristive systems are dynamical systems defined by \\([0]\\)\n\n\\[\\dot{x}=f(x,u,t), \\tag{64}\\] \\[y=g(x,u,t)u, \\tag{63}\\]\n\nwhere \\(u\\) and \\(y\\) are the input and output of the system, and \\(x\\) denotes the state of the system. The connection between 63, 64 and 61, 62 is achieved by assigning \\(R(t+1)=y(t+1)\\), \\(Q(t+1)=x(t+1)\\), and \\(u=S(t)\\). Therefore, for each value of \\(t\\), we can realize the memristive system as a computational model.\n\n### Chain of harmonic oscillators\n\nThe harmonic oscillator satisfy a second-order differential equation of the form \\([0]\\)\n\n\\[\\ddot{x}+\\omega^{2}x=0 \\tag{65}\\]\n\nThe general solution is\n\n\\[x(t)=A\\sin(\\omega t)+B\\cos(\\omega t), \\tag{66}\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants.\n\nA single harmonic oscillator does not define a computational model by itself, some interactions with the environment are needed to define a computational model. Consider a chain of \\(N\\) identical harmonic oscillators as the machine \\(M\\), the interaction of a single harmonic oscillator with other oscillators would affect the whole system. In other words, it provides some stimulus \\(S\\) to the whole system, regardless of whether this stimulus is large or negligible. The response \\(R\\) could be described as the changing of some measurable quantities in this chain due to the interaction with this single harmonic oscillator, such as the frequency modes, etc. The new displacement \\(x_{n}\\) of the \\(n\\)th oscillator defines the new state of the system \\(Q\\). It is sufficient to take just one oscillator within the chain and study its change in"

As a result of the interesting performance of this decoder, several studies discussing ML decoders for the rotated planar code have been proposed such as the deep neural network based decoder in (Chamberland and Ronagh, 2018; Varsamopoulos et al., 2020) or the reinforcement learning based decoder in (Sweke et al., 2020). The deep neural network decoder proved a better threshold than MWPM at the cost of a higher complexity, while the reinforcement learning decoder proved an almost linear complexity at the cost of a worse code threshold (Varsamopoulos et al., 2020). Combinations of NN decoders with RG decoders have also been proposed (Varsamopoulos et al., 2020). Machine learning based decoding methods have also been proposed for other topological codes such as the toric code (Andreasson et al., 2019; Domingo Colomer et al., 2020; Fitzek et al., 2020; Krastanov and Jiang, 2017; Liu and Poulin, 2019; Meinerz et al., 2022; Ni, 2020; Torlai and Melko, 2017; Wagner et al., 2020), the color code (Baireuther et al., 2019) or the semionic code (Varona and Martin-Delgado, 2020). Each of the proposed ML decoders for each of the codes provide either a faster decoding or a better threshold than other methods, showing the natural trade-off between accuracy and speed.\n\nCircuit level noise has also been considered for neural network decoders, i.e. faulty syndrome data arising from noisy gates and measurements (Baireuther et al., 2019; Chamberland et al., 2023; Chamberland and Ronagh, 2018; Varsamopoulos et al., 2017). In a similar fashion as other decoders, dealing with noisy measurements requires approximately \\(d\\) syndrome measurement rounds, implying that the runtime of the decoders increases. Importantly, NN decoder should be trained using this error model so that they can cope with it, i.e. training is specific to the noise model in consideration (Varsamopoulos et al., 2017). The performance of the NN decoder of (Varsamopoulos et al., 2017) achieves the same performance as MWPM for this scenario.\n\nTo sum up, NN decoders are promising in the quest of obtaining accurate and fast decoders for decoding not only rotated planar codes but also other families of error correcting codes. Some of the problematic behind this family of decoders is the training cost, which may scale exponentially with the code distance (Vasmer et al., 2021). This is one of the main reasons behind the fact that most of the NN-based decoders have only been tested for small distances \\(d&lt;10\\)(Meinerz et al., 2022). Interestingly, promising results have been obtained for decoding the toric code with an NN+UF decoder that achieves high threshold with almost linear complexity, while having been tested up to \\(d=255\\)(Meinerz et al., 2022). However, the need of a training stage before operation implies that NN and ML decoders might not be the best choice when the noise fluctuates over time, as it occurs for superconducting qubit platforms (Etxezarreta Martinez et al., 2021; Etxezarreta Martinez et al., 2023). Additionally, it is important to state that mapping the decoding problem to a ML classification problem works well for the rotated planar code or other topological codes since they encode a low number of logical qubits, implying that the possible logical errors is not too high. However, since the number of logical errors scales as \\(2^{2k}\\) with the number of logical qubits (Fuentes et al., 2022), \\(k\\), these methods may not be implementable for other families of codes with higher coding rates such as QLDPC codes.\n\n### MaxSAT decoder\n\nThe MaxSAT decoder has been recently proposed as an efficient algorithm to decode color codes (Berent et al., 2023). This decoder is based on the analogy between the decoding problem of the color code and the LightsOut puzzle when the error model in consideration is the bit-flip noise. The LightsOut puzzle refers to a problem where a lattice whose faces are associated with switches and lights can be either on or off. In such lattice, toggling a switch on the lattice implies that all its neighbouring lights change their previous state, i.e. if they were on they are turned of and vice versa. The LightsOut problem then tries to find out a sequence of switch actions so that all lights "

      "For a particular arrangement of input/output points considered in Fig. 1, one can indeed verify that the entanglement wedge for \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) is connected (Fig. 2). This powerful theorem states that the connected entanglement wedge is actually a generic feature whenever \\(c_{1},c_{2},r_{1},r_{2}\\) satisfy ( 2.8). The above argument, based on the \\(\\mathbf{B}_{84}\\) task, provides a quantum information theoretic proof of the connected wedge theorem. It turns out that the same statement can be proven from a geometric argument as well [49]. In Section 5.2, we will review the geometric proof and further generalize the theorem to the setup with a brane and in cutoff holography.\n\n## 3 Holographic quantum task with a brane\n\nIn this section, we examine whether the connected theorem holds in the intermediate picture in the case of pure global AdS\\({}_{3}\\) with an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane \\(Q\\). Namely, we demonstrate that the entanglement wedge for the input regions \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) is disconnected when one of the input signals emanates from the brane \\(Q\\).

      "For a particular arrangement of input/output points considered in Fig. 1, one can indeed verify that the entanglement wedge for \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) is connected (Fig. 2). This powerful theorem states that the connected entanglement wedge is actually a generic feature whenever \\(c_{1},c_{2},r_{1},r_{2}\\) satisfy ( 2.8). The above argument, based on the \\(\\mathbf{B}_{84}\\) task, provides a quantum information theoretic proof of the connected wedge theorem. It turns out that the same statement can be proven from a geometric argument as well [49]. In Section 5.2, we will review the geometric proof and further generalize the theorem to the setup with a brane and in cutoff holography.\n\n## 3 Holographic quantum task with a brane\n\nIn this section, we examine whether the connected theorem holds in the intermediate picture in the case of pure global AdS\\({}_{3}\\) with an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane \\(Q\\). Namely, we demonstrate that the entanglement wedge for the input regions \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) is disconnected when one of the input signals emanates from the brane \\(Q\\). A similar argument holds for cutoff holography as well if one replaces the ETW brane \\(Q\\) with an inhomogeneous cutoff surface \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) with the same profile.\n\nWe would like to note that a previous work [58] studied a scattering process involving a brane in a different setup.

This means that if our logical circuit uses m T gates - and therefore requires m \\(|T\\rangle\\) states - we need to choose a probability of distilled state failure p dist such that m \u00d7 p dist is within our error bounds. The second aspect we need to consider is the time required to generate each \\(|T\\rangle\\) state. In order to avoid logical qubits remaining idle as we wait for \\(|T\\rangle\\) states to be generated, we need to ensure that \\(|T\\rangle\\) states are generated fast enough that they are available as and when they are needed. This depends on both the number of QEC rounds required to generate the \\(|T\\rangle\\) states, but also the number of QEC rounds required to implement these logical operations. If we implement Clifford gates directly as described in Section III B, the circuit primarily consists of alternating sequences of Hadamard gates, which take 3 d +4 QEC rounds, and T-like gates, which take between d + 1 and 5 d/2 + 4 QEC rounds, depending on whether or not an S gate correction is required. This means that when implementing Clifford gates directly, a \\(|T\\rangle\\) state needs to be produced at least once every 4 d + 5 QEC rounds. In comparison, when Clifford operations have been moved through the circuit as described in Section III C, the only operations required are a single joint Pauli measurement and a single X basis measurement, meaning that a \\(|T\\rangle\\) state must be produced every d + 1 QEC rounds. If a single distillation protocol cannot generate states fast enough, multiple instances of the protocol can be run in parallel to generate states more frequently, at the cost of increasing the number of physical qubits [12]. As we show in Appendix D, up to four factories can be placed around the two corners at the top of the routing space. It is possible to add even more factories beyond these four, but doing so could require additional space for routing and storage of \\(|T\\rangle\\) states. On the other hand, if a logical \\(|T\\rangle\\) state can be generated faster than required, additional storage space is required to protect the state from errors while it waits to be consumed, which can be included as part of the routing space estimates. B. Estimating code distance To reduce the probability of a logical error occurring on one of our logical qubits, we can tweak the code distance d. A higher distance will reduce the probability of getting a sequence of physical errors which lead to a logical error, but comes at the cost of increasing both the number of physical qubits per logical qubit, and the number of QEC rounds per logical operation. In the case of the surface code, the probability of a logical error on a single logical qubit per code cycle assuming a depolarising noise model can be estimated as\n\n\\[p_{L}(p,d)=0.1(100p)^{(d+1)/2}, \\tag{25}\\]\n\nwhere p is the physical error probability [10, 12, 53]. For the purpose of this application, we want to choose a sufficiently high d that the probability of a logical error occurring on any qubit during any QEC round is within our error bound. We use Equation 25 to approximate \n\nFigure 17: Layout of logical patches for implementing joint Pauli measurements.

      "provides a useful example.24 Taking historical evidence seriously into account, then, one should not believe that with quantum mechanics or quantum field theory we achieved a final theory of matter. On the contrary, past scientific theories indicate that it is unlikely that we will ever achieve experimental evidence for a framework valid at all levels. Hence, says Bohm\n\nFootnote 24: As Bohm correctly highlights \u201cconclusions drawn only within the limited domain of the previous laws were however never overturned\u201d, Bohm (1953a), p. 286.\n\nit is necessary to formulate our theories in such a way that we explicitly recognize the possibility of an inexhaustible number of new levels, in which entirely new types of laws may be needed. If we do this, then even if we discover that simple Newtonian types of laws do hold in the domain of 10\\({}^{-13}\\)cm, we know that the final course of the world is not necessarily determined \u201cmechanically\u201d by such laws. For there is a continual interaction between all levels; and the more complex laws that may be appropriate to the unlimited number of new levels (which we have hardly even begun to scratch) could easily invalidate the conclusions coming from the unfounded extrapolation of Newtonian laws to *all* levels. Thus, the unsatisfactory aspects of Newtonian types of laws are not present in a theory that limits itself to a finite domain, in which it might hope to verify such laws; but are present only when we try to fit all possible future human knowledge into the limited conceptual framework of these laws (Bohm (1953a), p. 286).\n\nNotably in a footnote to the above quotation Bohm explicitly says that \u201cbelow the level of 10\\({}^{-13}\\)cm probably lies still another level, etc. ad infinitum\u201d, which completes the very first published illustration of his views about reality\u2014which discloses an infinity of different layers\u2014and of science itself, whose goal is not to find absolute and universal truths, but rather to find the correct types of laws and entities at every given level. Thus, since Bohm denied that reality has a fundamental bottom ground\u2014thereby rejecting any sort of foundationalism\u2014we can claim that he endorsed a form of metaphysical infinitism.25\n\nFootnote 25: More details will be given below. For an interesting discussion of foundationalism and infinitism cf. Tahko (2018).\n\nIt is interesting for our discussion to point out that such ideas were already present before the publication of the 1952 papers, as shown by Bohm\u2019s letter to the mathematician Miriam Yevick dated 28 November 1951: \u201cAnother important concept that must be gotten across is that of the infinite number of levels, that must be used in describing the behaviour of matter. Such a point of view automatically prevents us from closing our concepts, at any particular level\u201d (Talbot (2017), p. 207). A few months later on 7 January 1952, Bohm sent another letter to her explaining how the diachronic existence of things depends on the motion of infinite layers of reality:\n\nHow then do we explain the prevalence of change and the transiency of material things? This is done by the notion of endless transformation. The \u201cthings\u201d at each level, are made up of smaller \u201celements\u201d at a more fundamental level, and it is the motion of these more fundamental elements (not usually directly visible to us, except with the aid of elaborate scientific research) which causes the appearance and disappearance of the \u201cthings\u201d existing at a higher level. These more fundamental \u201celements\u201d however, cannot be permanent, but must be made up of still more fundamental \u201celements\u201d *and so on ad infinitum*. Thus, we can see that every \u201cthing\u201d that exists may at some time come into existence and later go out of existence, but there is always a deeper level, in terms of which this change can be viewed rationally as a transformation of a more elementary form of matter, which is not itself basically altered in this particular transformation.

Unconventional TPTs without gap closing also exist [29, 30] analogously to the unconventional cases in the quantum spin Hall effect with strong electron-electron interactions [102] and the quantum anomalous Hall effect with disorder [103]. These unconventional TPTs lie in the ground state by a mechanism of node introduction from the infinity [29, 30]. On the other hand, it is found that unconventional TPTs emerge more frequently in excited states, especially around level anti-crossings [31]. Here from the JC-Stark model we can gain some insight for the origin of such unconventional TPTs in excited states.\n\nIn Fig. 6 panel (a) shows the energy spectrum of the JC-Stark model, where levels are crossing among the all states with negative parity (blue solid) and positive parity (red dotted). Panel (b) gives the spin winding number \\(n_{w}\\) (solid line) of the ground state ( j E = 1) which jumps always at parity variation (dotted line) and gap closing (similar to the solid line in panel (f)). The spin winding can turn direction in excited states, as indicated by the negative values of n\\({}_{w}\\) in panel (d) for state j E = 20 according to the discussion in Sect. IV G . Each jump of n\\({}_{w}\\) is accompanied with a TPT. In particular, some TPTs occur without parity variation, as illustrated in panel (e) for state j E = 2, which comes from the level crossing between same parity states. Note here the gap is sill closing at the transitions despite no parity variation. What interesting is, once we add anisotropy, e.g. \u03bb = 0 . 01, the gap at these TPTs opens, as demonstrated by the energy spectrum by panel (b) and more clearly by the dotted line in panel (f).

The subsystem code is defined on such a complex as follows (recall that the 3-cells are also bicolorable by construction). A qubit is associated to each 1-cell \\(e\\in E\\). A gauge generator \\(g\\in\\mathcal{G}\\) is associated to each corner of a 3-cell, and is \\(X\\)-type or \\(Z\\)-type according to the color of the 3-cell.

Stabilizers commute with each other and all gauge generators. Mapping from the FBQC version of the fusion complex to the 3d subsystem code, one simply replaces fusions by qubits, and maps the support of resource-state stabilizers and check operators to these qubits appropriately: resource state stabilizers correspond to gauge generators and checks of the fusion network correspond to stabilizers of the subsystem code.

KL divergence between empirical distributions of samples and the original RBM.\n\ndistribution to Eq.

We can derive the update rule for each internal parameter from Eq. ( 9 ) similar to Eq. ( 10 ) as \u03b4\u03b2 vh = \u03b7 ( \u2211 i , j w i j v i h j ) S \u2212 \u2211 i , j w i j v i h j ) \u03c7 , \u03b4\u03b2 v = \u03b7 ( \u2211 i b i v i ) S \u2212 \u2211 i b i v i ) \u03c7 , \u03b4\u03b2 h = \u03b7 ( \u2211 j c j h j ) S \u2212 \u2211 j c j h j ) \u03c7 , \u03b4\u03b2 vi = \u03b7 ( b i v i ) S \u2212 b i v i ) \u03c7 , \u03b4\u03b2 hj = \u03b7 ( c j h j ) S \u2212 c j h j ) \u03c7 . The same algorithm can be applied by replacing line 8 in ESTIMATE_BETA of Fig. 2 with corresponding update rules in Eq. 14 . These patterns of internal parameters are hereinafter referred as one-parameter, three-parameter, and one-and-all-bias, respectively. The estimation of many internal parameters requires a large number of samples. Because the proposed method is an online estimation scheme, an increase in internal parameters leads to an increase in estimation time. If we introduce a calibration parameter for each cross term v i h j , the increase in parameters is the product of n and m, which may significantly increase estimation time. We, therefore, focus on the above three patterns of internal parameters. **Experiments**\n\nFirst, we validated the proposed estimation scheme for the internal parameters without training. The CD algorithm trained an RBM comprising 32 visible nodes and 8 hidden nodes in advance using the coarse-grained MNIST training dataset, similar to prior studies 42 . The same RBM was embedded in 12 locations of D-Wave 2000Q without faulty qubits to gather samples efficiently. We compared samples generated by Gibbs sampling and quantum annealing with those calibrated by the proposed scheme. Table 1 shows the results of KL divergence. The increase in the size of samples decreased KL divergence because the empirical distributions approach the original distribution. In theory, Gibbs sampling can accurately obtain samples following the Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, results close to those obtained by Gibbs sampling can be considered more accurate. We found that the increased number of internal parameters improved sample quality. To determine the reason, Fig. 3 presents histograms of the samples\u2019 energies. Although one parameter can adjust the total energy E, the samples\u2019 distributions of E vh and E v exhibit differences between Gibbs sampling and quantum annealing. E v of the three-parameter case and E vh of one-and-all-bias case seem to fit well with Gibbs sampling. Quantum annealers have not only temperature differences, but imperfections of qubits. We consider many internal parameters that can be calibrated to improve sample quality. Next, we conducted RBM training with the simultaneous estimation of internal parameters. The RBM size and training data were identical to the previous experiment. The number of times for updating \u03b2 in each epoch was set to five. The increase in the number of samples was 0.5% for one-parameter case and 0.2% for three-parameter case. The increase in the number of samples was 0.1% for one-and-all-bias case and 0.1% for three-and-all-bias case. The increase in the number of samples was "

( 1 ), we introduce two patterns of internal parameters and distributions:\n\n\\[P(v,h|\\theta,\\beta vh ,\\beta v,\\beta h) =\\frac{\\exp\\left(\\beta vh \u2211 i , j w i j v i h j + \u03b2 v \u2211 i b i v i + \u03b2 h \u2211 j c j h j\\right)}{Z_{\\beta vh,vh}}, \\tag{12}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[P(v,h|\\theta,\\beta vh ,\\beta v1,...,\\beta vh ,\\beta h1 ,..., \\beta hm) =\\frac{\\exp\\left(\\beta vh \u2211 i , j w i j v i h j + \u2211 i \u03b2 vi b i v i + \u2211 j \u03b2 hj c j h j\\right)}{Z_{\\beta vh,vi,hj}}. \\tag{13}\\]\n\nWe can derive the update rule for each internal parameter from Eq. ( 9 ) similar to Eq. ( 10 ) as\n\n\\[\\delta\\beta vh =\\eta\\left(\\left\\langle\\sum_{i , j}w i j v i h j\\right\\rangle_{S}-\\left\\langle\\sum_{i , j}w i j v i h j\\right\\rangle_{\\chi}\\right), \\tag{14}\\] \\[\\delta\\beta v =\\eta\\left(\\left\\langle\\sum_{i}b i v i\\right\\rangle_{S}-\\left\\langle \\sum_{i}b i v i\\right\\rangle_{\\chi}\\right),\\] \\[\\delta\\beta h =\\eta\\left(\\left\\langle\\sum_{j}c j h j\\right\\rangle_{S}-\\left\\langle \\sum_{j}c j h j\\right\\rangle_{\\chi}\\right),\\] \\[\\delta\\beta vi =\\eta\\left(\\left\\langle b i v i\\right\\rangle_{S}-\\left\\langle b i v i \\right\\rangle_{\\chi}\\right),\\] \\[\\delta\\beta hj =\\eta\\left(\\left\\langle c j h j\\right\\rangle_{S}-\\left\\langle c j h j \\right\\rangle_{\\chi}\\right).\\]\n\nThe same algorithm can be applied by replacing line 8 in ESTIMATE_BETA of Fig. 2 with corresponding update rules in Eq. 14. These patterns of internal parameters are hereinafter referred as one-parameter, three-parameter, and one-and-all-bias, respectively. The estimation of many internal parameters requires a large number of samples. Because the proposed method is an online estimation scheme, an increase in internal parameters leads to an increase in estimation time. If we introduce a calibration parameter for each cross term v i h j, the increase in parameters is the product of n and m, which may significantly increase estimation time. We, therefore, focus on the above three patterns of internal parameters.\n\n## Experiments\n\nFirst, we validated the proposed estimation scheme for the internal parameters without training. The CD algorithm trained an RBM comprising 32 visible nodes and 8 hidden nodes in advance using the coarse-grained MNIST training dataset, similar to prior studies 42 . The same RBM was embedded in 12 locations of D-Wave 2000Q without faulty qubits to gather samples efficiently. We compared samples generated by Gibbs sampling and quantum annealing with those calibrated by the proposed scheme. Table 1 shows the results of KL divergence. The increase in the size of samples decreased KL divergence because the empirical distributions approach the original distribution. In theory, Gibbs sampling can accurately obtain samples following the Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, results close to those obtained by Gibbs sampling can be considered more accurate. We found that the increased number of internal parameters improved sample quality. To determine the reason, Fig. 3 presents histograms of the samples\u2019 energies. Although one parameter can adjust the total energy E, the samples\u2019 distributions of E vh and E v exhibit differences between Gibbs sampling and quantum annealing. E v of "

As one of the most important bosonic codes, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is proposed to correct small displacement error in phase space. If the noise in phase space is biased, square-lattice GKP code can be concatenated with XZZX surface code or repetition code that promises a high fault-tolerant threshold to suppress the logical error. In this work, we study the performance of GKP repetition codes with physical ancillary GKP qubits in correcting biased noise. We find that there exists a critical value of noise variance for the ancillary GKP qubit such that the logical Pauli error rate decreases when increasing the code size. Furthermore, one round of GKP error correction has to be performed before concatenating with repetition code. Our study paves the way for practical implementation of error correction by concatenating GKP code with low-level qubit codes.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nNoise is the main hindrance to achieve large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. Quantum error correcting code is introduced to correct errors by using redundancy in the Hilbert space [1 \u2013 3 ]. Bosonic codes protect finite-dimensional logical space by encoding it in an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system [4 , 5 ], e.g., a simple harmonic oscillator. Compared to the standard qubit codes that encode a single logical qubit using many physical qubits, the bosonic code is more hardware efficient and is subject to a smaller number of noisy channels [6 , 7 ]. Currently well established bosonic codes include Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code [8 , 9 ], cat code [10 , 11 ], binomial code [12 \u2013 14 ], and rotation-symmetric code [15 , 16 ]. The GKP code is one of the most promising bosonic codes, which corrects small displacement errors in phase space and also photon loss [6 , 17 ]. Although the GKP code has been proposed for two decades [8 ], it is prepared only recently in ion-trapped [18 , 19 ] and superconducting [20 ] platforms, and is used to extend the decoherence time of the logical qubit through error correction. The GKP code has promising advantages in optical quantum information processing [21 ], however optical GKP states have not been experimentally generated due to the stringent requirement for strong nonlinearity, though various preparation schemes have been proposed [22 \u2013 26 ].\n\nIn order to achieve fault tolerance, the common strategy is to concatenate the GKP code with qubit codes to further suppress the logical error. Examples include concatenation with surface/toric codes [27 \u2013 32 ], color code [33 \u2013 35 ] etc. Concatenation with qubit codes with a high threshold enables a low squeezing threshold for the GKP states around 10 dB [27 ], which is within the reach of near-term technologies.

As one of the most important bosonic codes, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is proposed to correct small displacement error in phase space. If the noise in phase space is biased, square-lattice GKP code can be concatenated with XZZX surface code or repetition code that promises a high fault-tolerant threshold to suppress the logical error. In this work, we study the performance of GKP repetition codes with physical ancillary GKP qubits in correcting biased noise. We find that there exists a critical value of noise variance for the ancillary GKP qubit such that the logical Pauli error rate decreases when increasing the code size. Furthermore, one round of GKP error correction has to be performed before concatenating with repetition code. Our study paves the way for practical implementation of error correction by concatenating GKP code with low-level qubit codes.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nNoise is the main hindrance to achieve large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. Quantum error correcting code is introduced to correct errors by using redundancy in the Hilbert space [1 \u2013 3 ]. Bosonic codes protect finite-dimensional logical space by encoding it in an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system [4 , 5 ], e.g., a simple harmonic oscillator. Compared to the standard qubit codes that encode a single logical qubit using many physical qubits, the bosonic code is more hardware efficient and is subject to a smaller number of noisy channels [6 , 7 ]. Currently well established bosonic codes include Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code [8 , 9 ], cat code [10 , 11 ], binomial code [12 \u2013 14 ], and rotation-symmetric code [15 , 16 ]. The GKP code is one of the most promising bosonic codes, which corrects small displacement errors in phase space and also photon loss [6 , 17 ]. Although the GKP code has been proposed for two decades [8 ], it is prepared only recently in ion-trapped [18 , 19 ] and superconducting [20 ] platforms, and is used to extend the decoherence time of the logical qubit through error correction. The GKP code has promising advantages in optical quantum information processing [21 ], however optical GKP states have not been experimentally generated due to the stringent requirement for strong nonlinearity, though various preparation schemes have been proposed [22 \u2013 26 ].\n\nIn order to achieve fault tolerance, the common strategy is to concatenate the GKP code with qubit codes to further suppress the logical error. Examples include concatenation with surface/toric codes [27 \u2013 32 ], color code [33 \u2013 35 ] etc. Concatenation with qubit codes with a high threshold enables a low squeezing threshold for the GKP states around 10 dB [27 ], which is within the reach of near-term technologies. A variant of the original surface code, known as the XZZX surface code [36 ], has recently been shown to have a higher threshold for biased noise. It is expected that concatenation of GKP code with XZZX surface code would enable lower squeezing threshold if the displacement error is biased [37 ]. This can happen in two cases, either the noise is biased and a square-lattice (isotropic) GKP code is used, or the noise is isotropic and a biased GKP code is used. However, syndrome measurement and decoding are still complicated for the XZZX surface code [38 ], which therefore consume more physical and computational resources. A relatively easier scheme to suppress biased noise is to concatenate GKP code with repetition code [39 ], which requires easier syndrome measurement and decoding, and has a higher threshold. In Ref. [39 ], the error threshold has been estimated for biased GKP repetition code with isotropic noise, which outperforms the biased planar surface code [29 ]. However, both the data and ancillary GKP qubits are assumed to be ideal, namely, with infinitely energy. The error threshold as derived in Ref. [39 ] therefore only"

The observed broadening could be due to homogeneous factors that would affect a single center on the timescale of our measurements including phonon-broadening, spectral diffusion and hyperfine interactions. It could also be due to inhomogeneous factors such as static microscopic electric and strain fields and isotope disorder. While significantly broader than the lifetime limit, the PLE ensemble linewidth is still remarkably narrow and is less than 100 times the lifetime limit. In comparison, the best ratio of inhomogeneous:radiative linewidths for _in-situ_ doped nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers is 1000 [31]; this ratio is even larger for REIs [22]. This narrow linewidth persists in transmission measurements. Fig. 1d shows the optical depth (OD) \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc51 through the \ud835\udc51 = 300 \u03bcm substrate, where \ud835\udefc is the frequency-dependent absorption constant. The In D0X absorption linewidth through the 300 \u03bcm-thick sample is only 10 % broader than the micro-PLE linewidth, suggesting that high optical homogeneity persists over large volumes. The Al and Ga D 0 X transmission measurements saturate at 11.5 OD. This saturation occurs when the resonant PL intensity from the sample exceeds the transmitted laser power. Assuming that the linewidth does not significantly vary between micro-PLE and transmission measurements, a fit to the wings of the transmission spectra give a peak OD of 25 for Ga and more than 300 for Al. High optical depth with such low residual doping densities is possible due to the large D 0 X oscillator strength. The area under each OD peak is proportional to the number of donors in the probed ensemble, and thus can be used to estimate the average donor density. The donor density of donor \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc65 = Al, Ga, In) can be estimated from [32] \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc65 = 8\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udf0c0 \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udf0c0 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf06 \ud835\udc65 ) 2 \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc65,rad \u222b \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udf08)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf08, where \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc56 is the degeneracy of state \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc5b is the index of refraction, \ud835\udf06 \ud835\udc65 is the vacuum transition wavelength, \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc65,rad is the zero-phonon-line radiative lifetime. We estimate the ZPL radiative lifetime as the total radiative lifetime determined by the slow decay component of the experimental lifetime, divided by the fraction of emission into the ZPL. This fraction is determined by the Huang-Rhys parameter [20] and the ratio of the two-electron satellite transitions to the phononassisted transitions. We obtain \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51 = 0.95 ns, 1.18 ns, and 1.52 ns for \ud835\udc65 = Al, Ga, and In, respectively. Using Eq. 1, we find \ud835\udc41 Al = 7.5 \u00b7 10^15 cm^\u22123, \ud835\udc41 Ga = 9.9 \u00b7 10^14 cm^\u22123, and \ud835\udc41 In = 7.4 \u00b7 10^13 cm^\u22123. These values, measured for Sample A, are within an order of magnitude of the SIMS values measured for sample B. The relative concentrations are consistent with the PL spectra for this sample (App. C). An optical depth \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc51 \u226b 1 is a critical requirement for the development of efficient optical quantum memories [2]. Warm atomic vapors [33] and cold atoms [34] can achieve optical depths from the tens up to a thousand in cm-scale devices. These high optical depths are more challenging to achieve in solid-state systems which typically have much lower oscillator strengths [22,23] and large inhomogeneous broadening. In comparison, the ZnO donor-bound exciton system combines high oscillator strength, high homogeneity, and optical depth at residual donor densities. Defect-phonon interactions are typically considered a homogeneous broadening mechanism due to the fast timescale.

      "take place before a magic state becomes a stabilizer state [ 21 , 32 ]. The relative entropy of magic, the stabilizer fidelity, and the generalized robustness of magic are instances of magic monotones based on a quantum relative entropy and can be defined for any resource theory. A fundamental problem is whether the magic monotones based on a quantum relative entropy are additive under tensor products, and if not, under which conditions they become additive. However, very little is known about the additivity properties of these monotones. Besides its theoretical interest, the latter property is practically useful since it allows us to reduce the computation of the magic resource of the \u2018whole\u2019 to just the sum of one of the \u2018parts\u2019. The computation of these monotones becomes soon unfeasible for multi-qubit states as the number of qubits grows. This is because the number of pure stabilizer states scales super-exponentially with the number of qubits. For numerical experiments, we are limited to just five-qubit states [ 19 , 32 ]. The additivity property allows us to overcome this problem for tensor products of low-dimensional multi-qubit states. In this case, the total magic resource just equals the sum of the one of each state, which is computable. The additivity property allows us to compute upper bounds for state transformations. In particular, we can obtain upper bounds for the ratio \\(m/k\\) in the transformation \\(\\rho^{\\otimes k}\\to\\sigma^{\\otimes m}\\) under free operations. Moreover, the results on the relative entropy of magic allow us to derive upper bounds for asymptotic state transformation. In this way, we obtain much tighter bounds for one-shot state transformation than the one previously known, which used the generalized robustness. Moreover, we obtain new (closed-form) upper bounds for transformations involving specific two and three-qubit mixed states, e.g. the depolarized Toffoli state (see Section 6 for more details). We now summarize the main results of this work. In Section 3 , we prove that the stabilizer fidelity is multiplicative for tensor products of any number of single-qubit states. We then extend this result to include a continuous set of magic monotones, namely all the \\(\\alpha\\)-\\(z\\) R\u00b4enyi relative entropies of magic in the range \\(|(1-\\alpha)/z|=1\\). In this way, we also independently recover the multiplicativity of the generalized robustness of magic for all single-qubit states established in [ 32 ]. In Section 4 , we prove that the relative entropy of magic is additive for single-qubit states if all of them but one commute with their optimizer, i.e. the closest stabilizer state. Moreover, in Section 8 , we show that the latter class includes the T,H, and F states subject to depolarizing noise. These are the states involved in the standard magic state distillation scenario where any initial state is first projected onto a symmetry axis of the octahedron by applying the stabilizer twirling, from which one aims to distill a better pure magic state [ 7 , 8 ]. We extend this result to all the \\(\\alpha\\)-\\(z\\) R\u00b4enyi relative entropies of magic. Finally, we also show that the relative entropy of magic is not additive for general two multi-qubit states by providing a counterexample. In Section 5 , we prove that all the \\(\\alpha\\)-\\(z\\) R\u00b4enyi relative entropies of magic are additive for two and three-qubit states that belong to a specific class. In Section 8 , we show that the latter class includes the Toffoli, Hoggar, and CS states subject to global depolarizing noise. In Section 6 we discuss in detail the implication of the above additivity results to magic state transformation. This allows us to obtain upper bounds on magic state distillation and dilution. In Section 7 , we give closed-form expressions for the stabilizer fidelity and the generalized robustness of magic for single-qubit states. The latter monotone benchmarks several proposed classical simulators (see [ 32 ] for more details). Moreover, for single-qubit states, the generalized robustness of magic is equal to the dyadic negativity and the mixed-state extent [ 32 , Theorem 3]. In Section 8 we give a closed-form expression for all the \\(\\alpha\\)-\\(z\\) R\u00b4enyi relative entropies of magic for T, H, F, Toffoli, Hoggar, and CS magic states subject to global depolarizing noise.\n\n "

      "a sequential circuit of depth O( L z ) to combine them into an X-cube model of height O( L z ) cubes and with smooth boundaries (Fig. 11b ). The same circuit can be used to prepare the X-cube model with periodic boundary condition in the vertical direction with fewer starting trivial qubits. To be specific, under periodic boundary conditions, the layer of trivial qubits shown in purple is not needed along the vertical direction and the orange layer at the bottom will connect to the top orange layer. The entangling gates as shown in Fig. 11b will then prepare the X-cube model on a 3-torus. However, if we first prepare the height L z X-cube model with smooth boundaries and then convert it to the X-cube model on a 3-torus with height L z + 1 by doing local gates at the top layer, we need a sequential circuit as shown in Fig. 11c . We add a layer of trivial qubits on vertical edges above the top smooth boundary in state |+); these vertical edges now connect to the bottom smooth boundary due to periodic boundary conditions. Using these vertical qubits as control qubits, we do CNOT gates sequentially to prepare the layer of cube stabilizers. The CNOT gates that are applied in parallel are specified by the choice of the control qubits shown on the vertical edges with the same color and along the diagonal (left of Fig. 11c ) and by the gates shown (right of Fig. 11c ). Thus, to convert the X-cube model with smooth boundaries into a 3-torus, we need a sequential circuit of depth O( L x + L y ) (Fig. 11c ). A generalization of the X-cube model is the Ising cage-net model which is obtained from a coupled layer construction of double-Ising string-net models instead of Toric Code layers [ 35 ]. In Ref. 25 , a generalized notion of foliation and a sequential circuit for preparation of the Ising Cage-net model is presented. For the X-cube model, the resource Toric Code layers can be prepared in parallel before being inserted one by one into the bulk to increase the size of the X-cube model. For Ising Cage-net, however, this is not possible. Using the scheme presented in Ref. 25 , a thin slab (of small L z ) of Ising Cage-net can first be prepared with O( L x + L y ) steps. Then the height of the slab L z can be increased one at a time, each time requiring a circuit of depth O( L x + L y ). Therefore, overall a quadratic (O( L 2 )) depth circuit is needed to generate the Ising Cage-net model. Whether one can do better than quadratic circuit depth for the Ising cage-net model is left as an open question. It will also be interesting to construct sequential circuit maps for more general fracton models such as the type-2 fracton models which have fractal-shaped logical operators [ 32 ].\n\n### p-string condensation circuit for X-cube model\n\nWe now construct a linear-depth sequential circuit for the preparation of the X-cube model using p-string condensation [ 34 , 35 ]. We first consider three decoupled stacks of Toric Codes in xy, yz, and zx planes such that a part of this stack z > L has undergone p-string condensation. That is, Z \u2212 Z stabilizers have been added to the double edges of the 3-foliated stack lattice for z > L . The resulting X-cube model is shown in Fig. 12a.

      "The variational quantum eigensolver is a hybrid quantum-classical approach to obtain an approximation for the ground state of a (quantum) system [ 116 ]. The algorithm uses the quantum device to prepare an ansatz state in form of a parametric quantum circuit. Based on the measurement outcome of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, a classical minimization algorithm is used to obtain a new set of parameters. Running the feedback loop between the classical computer and the quantum device until convergence, one obtains an approximation for the ground state and its energy, provided the chosen ansatz is expressive enough and the optimization did not converge to a local minimum. Main limitations of the VQE are barren plateaus (see Sec. IV B 2). VQD is an extension of the VQE allowing for computing low-lying excitations by running a VQE looking for a low energy state that is orthogonal to all previous states [ 117 ]. SSVQE is another approach used to compute excited states. This algorithm searches a low energy subspace by supplying orthogonal input states to the variational ansatz [ 118 ]. All the variational algorithms can be applied to Hamiltonians in both theoretical models and experimental analysis. 2. Tensor Networks Tensor Networks are a family of entanglement-based ans\u00a8atze providing an efficient parametrization of the physically relevant moderately entangled states [ 10 , 12 ]. TN algorithms allow for computing ground states, lowlying excitations, thermal states and to a certain extent real-time dynamics. While TN are extremely successful in situations with moderate entanglement, they cease to work for highly entangled scenarios such as outof-equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, in higher dimensions the numerical algorithms are computationally challenging but have a polynomial scaling in tensor size, thus allowed for first proof-of-principle demonstrations for LGTs [ 21 , 83 ]. 3. QAOA can be seen as a special type of VQE, where the intial state is given by \\(\\bigotimes|+\\rangle\\) and the parametric ansatz circuit in its plain vanilla form consists of a series of two alternating types of layers, each one containing a single real parameter. The first one is the exponential of the problem Hamiltonian, \\(\\exp(-i\\gamma\\mathcal{H})\\), followed by a mixing layer corresponding to \\(R_{X}(\\beta_{i})\\) gates applied to each qubit. In the limit of infinitely many layers, QAOA can be interpreted as an adiabatic evolution of an eigenstate of the \\(X\\) operator to the one of the problem Hamiltonian. From a theoretical point of view the performance of QAOA is not entirely clear, it seems to depend on various factors and does not necessarily outperform classical algorithms [ 368 \u2013 370 ]. Furthermore, the resulting quantum circuits can be deep making them hard to implement on noisy hardware [ 318 , 371 ]. However, some of these issues may be alleviated by algorithmic advances such as warm-starts [ 372 ] and counteradiabatic driving [ 373 ]. 4. QKMEANS The classical \\(k-\\)means is an efficient algorithm to classify data into \\(k\\) clusters based on an unlabeled set of training vectors. It belongs to the family of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The number \\(k\\) of clusters must be known _a priori_ which somewhat limits the range of its application in HEP. The algorithm is iterative and assigns at each step a training vector to the nearest centroid. The centroid location is then updated according to the average over the cluster of vectors associated at the current step to the centroid. The most time/resources consuming part of the algorithm is the calculation of the distance. In the classical version, using Lloyd\u2019s version of the algorithm, the time complexity is \\(\\mathcal{O}(NM)\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of features and \\(M\\) is the number of training examples [ 374 \u2013 376 ]. The quantum version of the \\(k-\\)means algorithm provides an exponential speedup for very large dimensions of a training vector. This is achieved through the introduction of two quantum subroutines, _SwapTest_ and _DistCalc_, for the distance calculation [ 377 ] and quantum subroutine _GroverOptim_ to assign a vector to the closest centroid cluster [ 378 ]. 5. Quantum Kernels Quantum kernels are a supervised quantum machine learning algorithm for classification and regression. The inputs can either be quantum (i.e., quantum states with an associated classical label) or fully classical (i.e. input-output data pairs). For the latter, the input classical data is first embedded into quantum states. For a quantum speed-up over classical algorithms, it is important to use an embedding (also called a quantum feature map) that is capable of recognizing classically intractable features [ 296 , 379 , 380 ]. For a given input pair of inputs one then evaluates a similarity measure between two encoded quantum states on a quantum computer.\n\n "

SSVQE is another approach used to compute excited states. This algorithm searches a low energy subspace by supplying orthogonal input states to the variational ansatz [118]. All the variational algorithms can be applied to Hamiltonians in both theoretical models and experimental analysis.\n\n### Tensor Networks\n\nTensor Networks are a family of entanglement-based ans\u00a8atze providing an efficient parametrization of the physically relevant moderately entangled states [10, 12]. TN algorithms allow for computing ground states, low-lying excitations, thermal states and to a certain extent real-time dynamics. While TN are extremely successful in situations with moderate entanglement, they cease to work for highly entangled scenarios such as out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, in higher dimensions the numerical algorithms are computationally challenging but have a polynomial scaling in tensor size, thus allowed for first proof-of-principle demonstrations for LGTs [21, 82, 83].\n\n### QAOA\n\nThe quantum approximate optimization algorithm is a hybrid quantum-classical approach, originally designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems [367]. The problem is encoded in an Ising type Hamiltonian whose ground state is the optimal solution to the combinatorial optimization problem. QAOA can be seen as a special type of VQE, where the intial state is given by \\(\\bigotimes|+\\rangle\\) and the parametric ansatz circuit in its plain vanilla form consists of a series of two alternating types of layers, each one containing a single real parameter. The first one is the exponential of the problem Hamiltonian, \\(\\exp(-i\\gamma\\mathcal{H})\\), followed by a mixing layer corresponding to \\(R_{X}(\\beta_{i})\\) gates applied to each qubit. In the limit of infinitely many layers, QAOA can be interpreted as an adiabatic evolution of an eigenstate of the \\(X\\) operator to the one of the problem Hamiltonian. From a theoretical point of view the performance of QAOA is not entirely clear, it seems to depend on various factors and does not necessarily outperform classical algorithms [368, 369, 370]. Furthermore, the resulting quantum circuits can be deep making them hard to implement on noisy hardware [371, 318]. However, some of these issues may be alleviated by algorithmic advances such as warm-starts [372] and counteradiabatic driving [373].\n\n### QKMEANS\n\nThe classical \\(k-\\)means is an efficient algorithm to classify data into \\(k\\) clusters based on an unlabeled set of training vectors. It belongs to the family of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The number \\(k\\) of clusters must be known _a priori_ which somewhat limits the range of its application in HEP. The algorithm is iterative and assigns at each step a training vector to the nearest centroid. The centroid location is then updated according to the average over the cluster of vectors associated at the current step to the centroid. The most time/resources consuming part of the algorithm is the calculation of the distance. In the classical version, using Lloyd\u2019s version of the algorithm, the time complexity is \\(\\mathcal{O}(NM)\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of features and \\(M\\) is the number of training examples [374, 375, 376]. The quantum version of the \\(k-\\)means algorithm provides an exponential speed-up for very large dimensions of a training vector. This is achieved through the introduction of two quantum subroutines, _SwapTest_ and _DistCalc_, for the distance calculation [377] and quantum subroutine _GroverOptim_ to assign a vector to the closest centroid cluster [378].\n\n### Quantum Kernels\n\nQuantum kernels are a supervised quantum machine learning algorithm for classification and regression. The inputs can either be quantum (i.e., quantum states with an associated classical label) or fully classical (i.e. input-output data pairs). For the latter, the input classical data is first embedded into quantum states. For a quantum speed-up over classical algorithms, it is important to use an embedding (also "

It leads to the conclusion that strongly-entangled steady states emerge solely by two-body measurements with sufficient long-range properties. Late time dynamics of the negativity also supports this physical picture as shown in Fig. 2(b). That is, the saturation values of the negativity increase as enhancing the long-range measurement by decreasing | \u03b3 |, and quantum entanglement gets stronger as approaching the all-to-all case, while for short-range measurement, such correlation is suppressed.

Even for large negative \\(\\gamma\\)'s (the long-range property is suppressed), it remains negative. This indicates that the long-range property of the measurement generates strong correlations to the dynamics, especially on steady states.

Specifically, Figure 3 (a) demonstrates a strong unconventional magnon blockade effect at \u2206 = 9 . 03\u03c9 b with \u03bb = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u03c9 b, while Figure 3 (b) shows a strong unconventional photon blockade effect at \u2206 = \u2212 0 . 03\u03c9 b with \u03bb = 4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u03c9 b. These results agree with the analytically calculated optimal parameters. We note that when \u03bb = 0, implying the absence of magnon squeezing, the unconventional magnon blockade (UMB) cannot be achieved, whereas the conventional magnon blockade (CMB) is attainable at \u2206 \u2248 4 . 5\u03c9 b, as shown in Figure 3 (a). Additionally, for instance, when \u03bb = 500 Hz, a small dip appears corresponding to the conventional magnon blockade, as depicted in Figure 3 (a). On the other hand, in Figure 2 (a), when \u03bb = \u03bb opt , another small dip exists with \\(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)&gt;1\\), indicating a bunching effect. As anticipated in Figure 2 (b), the different curves lack a sharp dip, implying photon blockade cannot be achieved. In Fig. 4 (a), we depict the time evolution of the secondorder correlation function \\(g_{m}^{(2)}(\\tau)\\), which is calculated using the expression: \n\n\\[g_{m}^{(2)}(\\tau)=\\frac{\\langle m^{\\dagger}(t)m^{\\dagger}(t+\\tau)m(t+\\tau)m(t) \\rangle}{\\langle m^{\\dagger}(t)m(t)\\rangle^{2}}. \\tag{8}\\]\n\nThis quantity is a significant measure of the photon statistical properties. It is proportional to the joint probability of detecting one photon at t = 0 and detecting the next photon at t = \\(\\tau\\). It can be observed that for delay times \u03c4 &gt; 0, \\(g_{m}^{(2)}(\\tau)\\) is greater than \\(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\\). This indicates that the emitted photons exhibit blockade behavior and possess sub-Poissonian statistics. Notably, as the delay time \u03c4 increases, \\(g_{m}^{(2)}(\\tau)\\) also increases and approaches its maximum value (unity) at \u03c4 = 1 . 6\u00b5s\\), which corresponds approximately to the lifetime of the photons in the cavity. This signifies that with increasing time delay, photons become more coherent and exhibit stronger correlation.\n\nIn Fig. 4(b), we present the time evolution of the second-order correlation function, \\(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\\). It can be observed that \\(g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\\) decreases as time increases. Additionally, there is a significant oscillation in the initial short time, which is a result of the classical driving field. However, this oscillation gradually stabilizes, reaching a steady state. Throughout the time evolution, the second-order correlation function remains below 1 (g_{m}^{(2)}(0)\\ll 1\\)), ensuring the validity of a strong magnon blockade.\n\n### Pure dephasing effects\n\nPure dephasing can have a negative impact on the magnon (photon) blockade characteristics and introduce unwanted decoherence in the system. Hence, we investigate the influence of pure dephasing on cavity photon antibunching characteristics. To model the effects of pure dephasing, an additional Lindblad term of the form \\(\\mathcal{L}_{p}(\\rho)=\\frac{\\gamma_{p}}{2}[2c^{\\dagger}c\\rho c^{\\dagger}c-(c^{ \\dagger}c)^{2}\\rho-(c^{\\dagger}c)^{2}]\\) is included in the master equation, where \u03b3 p represents the pure dephasing rate of the cavity mode.\n\nIn Fig. 5(a)-(b), we present the plots of the equal-time second-order correlation function \\(g_{j}^{(2)}(0)\\) ( j = m, c ) against the detuning \u2206 for various values of the pure-dephasing rates \u03b3 p.

At the top of the structure a 220 nm thick high-bandgap Al0.30Ga0.70As0.03Sb0.97 op- tical window was deposited, also to reduce optical losses and to favor infrared optical access. The heterostructure layout of RTD-Sb is fully described in Ref. [ 26 ] where it was labeled as \u2018RTD 3\u2019.\n\nBoth samples were cooled down to a nominal tem- perature of T = 4 K in an ultra-low vibration cryostat (Attocube AttoDRY1000), associated with a homemade confocal microscope and a SourceMeter (Keithley 2400), to study their transport characteristics and the temporal evolution of the optical response emitted from their QWs at different applied voltages. Two excitation lasers (Pi- coQuant LDH Series) were employed for the optical exci- tation: one laser with emission energy \u210f\u03c9 = 1.70 eV and an optical power density of 2.29 kW/cm^2 to excite RTD-As, and another laser with energy \u210f\u03c9 = 1.15 eV and an optical power density of 12.5 kW/cm^2, used to excite RTD-Sb. Both lasers were operated in continuous-wave and pulsed modes to characterize the emission spectra and the temporal evolution via photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectroscopies, respectively. Dur- ing PL measurements, the optical responses of RTD-As and RTD-Sb observed at different bias voltages were dis- persed by a 75 and 50 cm spectrometer (Andor Sham- rock), respectively. Then, the signals were detected by a high-speed Si charge-coupled device (Andor iDus 420) and a high-resolution InGaAs diode array (Andor DU491A) for RTD-As and RTD-Sb, respectively.

      "tect that implements the imaginary time evolution trajectory without any need for quantum tomography or ancilla resources. This hybrid algorithm involves a classical time integration to generate the adiabatic Hamiltonian. When implemented faithfully, the algorithm leads to an exponential decrease of the infidelity with the groundstate of a desired Hamiltonian with adiabatic time. However, the cost of evolving exactly to long imaginary times grows rapidly with imaginary time both in the classical and quantum parts of the protocol. The growth in cost as a function of imaginary time arises from several sources, including the nonlocality of the derived adiabatic Hamiltonian. This nonlocality can be controlled by suitable heuristics which truncate terms in the adiabatic Hamiltonian. Another source of growing cost at long imaginary time is related to the norm of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its gap, for which modifications of the generating equation of the adiabatic Hamiltonian can be introduced and which should be further explored. However, because of the rapid decrease of the infidelity it is possible to propagate for short times and to observe a large improvement in the approximate ground-state. More generally, the A-QITE adiabatic path introduced in this work can be considered as extending the space of possible adiabatic paths; this potentially allows for introduction of new quantum adiabatic routines consisting of composite adiabatic paths (with A-QITE as one of them), with applications such as introduction of novel adiabatic catalysts [8, 24], etc. This is a direction to be explored in the future.\n\nOverall, a significant advantage of the current approach is that it can be implemented with a minimal amount of quantum resources (i.e. no ancillae and no measurement-based feedback). This makes our procedure a good match for near-term quantum architectures.\n\n## V Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Yu Tong, Alex Dalzell and Anthony Chen for helpful discussions.\n\nKH and GKC were supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, under grant no.

It is composed of two individual HCFs, measuring 3.38 km (NANF 1) and 4.34 km (NANF 2), that are spliced together (see Fig. 1 c). The average propagation loss of the NANF at a wavelength of 1550 nm is estimated to be 0.82 dB/km, which exceeds that of standard telecom SMF28 fiber. Nevertheless, recent advancements have shown that a so-called double nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (DNANF) lowers the propagation loss to 0.174 dB/km [ 25 ], which is approximately equal to that of SMF28 fiber. Moreover, HCFs can even surpass the fundamental loss limit imposed by Rayleigh scattering in solid-core fibers [ 18 ]. Our experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In brief, we generate polarization-entangled photon pairs. We then convert one polarization qubit into a timebin qubit, then transmit that time-bin qubit through a long distance fiber (either HCF or SMF28), and, finally, we convert the time-bin qubit back into a polarization qubit.

The measured spectral full width at half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of the source is \u2206 \u03bb \u2248 0.859 nm, and assuming transform limited Gaussian pulses, we calculate the coherence time of the photons to be \u03c4 c \u2248 4.1 ps (which yields \u03c4 c \u2248 2.4 ps when expressed as a standard deviation). Initially, we prepare a 2-qubit polarization-entangled Bell state |\u03a8^\u2212^\u232a = 1/2 |HV\u232a12 - |VH\u232a12 [ 27 ]. \"Photon 1\" is directly coupled to a quantum state tomography (QST) stage consisting of a quarter(QWP), a half-waveplate (HWP), and a polarizing beam splitter (PBS). Photons at each output port of the PBS are detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) from Single Quantum (Fig. 1 yellow area). Our detectors have an average detector jitter of \u2248 21 ps, an average detection efficiency of 87%, and a dark count rate < 100 Hz.

We find that the \\(3\\times 2\\) matrix has a higher transition temperature and is thus the only relevant order parameter at the superfluid transition. A fascinating problem, inherent to symmetry breaking described by matrix order parameters in general, concerns the question of which particular matrix is chosen during spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the present case, the Ginzburg\u2013Landau free energy functional derived from mean-field theory features many energetically degenerate ground states. For instance, mean-field theory does not dictate whether time-reversal symmetry is broken or not at the transition. This degeneracy of ground states at the mean-field level is common in similar systems such as bulk He-3 [1], d-wave superconductivity in 3D [34, 35], triple-point fermions [36], or complex tensor order [37, 38]. Remarkably, we find that in the present case, the many degenerate ground states actually only consists of two physically inequivalent configurations, the A-phase and the planar phase, whereas all other minima are related to these two via a symmetry transformation from \u02dc G. To resolve the question of whether the A-phase or the planar phase is energetically favored, we apply two theoretical approaches. First, we use the best available strong-coupling corrections for the Landau free energy from the 3D system and confirm that the A-phase is favored at the transition for all pressures. Second, we use weak-coupling perturbative renormalization group (RG) to incorporate order parameter fluctuations in the confined system, which predicts the planar phase to be favorable instead. This mismatch with observations indicates that even low pressures do not correspond to a weak coupling, but we also speculate on general issues of the perturbative RG to resolve second-order phase transitions of matrix order parameters. The lifting of the mean-field degeneracy due to fluctuations in the RG is unlike the case discussed in Ref. [36], where the degeneracy is protected by an enlarged symmetry. Experimentally, measuring the absence or presence of time-reversal symmetry at the transition could determine the condensation of the A-phase or planar phase, respectively. **I. PHYSICAL PICTURE: THE COOPER PROBLEM**\n\nTo illuminate the effect of confinement on the superfluid state, we first examine the associated Cooper problem. This amounts to solving the two-particle Schr\u00a8odinger equation in the presence of a static Fermi surface (FS). The formation of a bound state, the Cooper pair, and its functional dependence on the system parameters is often a good approximation of the superfluid instability found within mean-field theory for the actual many-body system, such as in spinor mass-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gases [39]. In the original Cooper problem, two atoms in 3D that experience a two-dimensional FS are interacting attractively, which leads to the formation of a shallow bound state. The atoms are described by the two-particle Schr\u00a8odinger equation\n\n\\[\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{4m}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}}^{2}-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m}\\nabla_{ \\mathbf{r}}^{2}-2\\mu-V(r)\\right]\\psi(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{r})=E\\psi(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r}), \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{R}=(X,Y,Z)^{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)^{T}\\) are the centerof-mass and relative coordinates of the two atoms, respectively, \\(\\mu\\) is the chemical potential, and \\(V(r)\\) the interaction potential. Here \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{r})\\) is the orbital part of the two-particle wavefunction. The spin part of the wavefunction is assumed to be a triplet state and has been factored out.

For instance, mean-field theory does not dictate whether time-reversal symmetry is broken or not at the transition. This degeneracy of ground states at the mean-field level is common in similar systems such as bulk He-3 [1], d-wave superconductivity in 3D [34, 35], triple-point fermions [36], or complex tensor order [37, 38]. Remarkably, we find that in the present case, the many degenerate ground states actually only consists of two physically inequivalent configurations, the A-phase and the planar phase, whereas all other minima are related to these two via a symmetry transformation from \\(\\tilde{G}\\).\n\nTo resolve the question of whether the A-phase or the planar phase is energetically favored, we apply two theoretical approaches. First, we use the best available strong-coupling corrections for the Landau free energy from the 3D system and confirm that the A-phase is favored at the transition for all pressures. Second, we use weak-coupling perturbative renormalization group (RG) to incorporate order parameter fluctuations in the confined system, which predicts the planar phase to be favorable instead. This mismatch with observations indicates that even low pressures do not correspond to a weak coupling, but we also speculate on general issues of the perturbative RG to resolve second-order phase transitions of matrix order parameters. The lifting of the mean-field degeneracy due to fluctuations in the RG is unlike the case discussed in Ref. [36], where the degeneracy is protected by an enlarged symmetry. Experimentally, measuring the absence or presence of time-reversal symmetry at the transition could determine the condensation of the A-phase or planar phase, respectively.\n\n## I Physical picture: the Cooper problem\n\nTo illuminate the effect of confinement on the superfluid state, we first examine the associated Cooper problem. This amounts to solving the two-particle Schrodinger equation in the presence of a static Fermi surface (FS). The formation of a bound state, the Cooper pair, and its functional dependence on the system parameters is often a good approximation of the superfluid instability found within mean-field theory for the actual many-body system, such as in spin- or mass-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gases [39].\n\nIn the original Cooper problem, two atoms in 3D that experience a two-dimensional FS are interacting attractively, which leads to the formation of a shallow bound state. The atoms are described by the two-particle Schrodinger equation\n\n\\[\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{4m}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}}^{2}-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m}\\nabla_ {\\mathbf{r}}^{2}-2\\mu-V(r)\\right]\\psi(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{r})=E\\psi(\\mathbf{R} ,\\mathbf{r}), \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{R}=(X,Y,Z)^{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)^{T}\\) are the center-of-mass and relative coordinates of the two atoms, respectively, \\(\\mu\\) is the chemical potential, and V ( r ) the interaction potential. Here \u03c8( R , r ) is the orbital part of the two-particle wavefunction. The spin part of the wavefunction is assumed to be a triplet state and has been factored out. To model confinement to quasi-2D, place the atoms in a box with length \\(L_{i}\\) in the i = x, y, z direction. The system is confined in the z direction in that \\(L z\\) is comparable to the superfluid coherence length \u03be = 70 nm of the bulk 3D system, whereas L x , L y \u226b \u03be. The Schrodinger equation is then solved with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the center-of-mass coordinate Z, "

      "in [88].\n\n## V Discussion\n\nIn summary, we propose a systematical scheme to reconstruct the non-Hermitian local Hamiltonian from a single pair of biorthogonal eigenstates using generalized quantum covariance matrix. This method is inherited from the quantum covariance matrix in hermitian systems. We apply our method in spin chain with Lee-Yang edge singularity and a non-Hermitian interacting fermion model. The numerical results accurately reproduce the input parent Hamiltonian in both cases. Then we discuss how to extend current approach for further application, including phase expansion, reconstruction for nondegenerate/degenerate biorthogonal eigenstates and detecting local conserved quantities in non-Hermitian systems. Our proposal answers non-Hermitian quantum inverse problem in a general sense and opens up several new directions of exploring non-Hermitian physics guided by biorthogonal eigenstates. We believe that more novel and meaningful non-Hermitian Hamiltonians could be established and some underlying symmetry could be revealed through our approach. Besides, it will be interesting to reconstruct local entanglement Hamiltonian in nonHermitian systems using our methods and discover conserved quantities associated with it, in parallel to the work in Hermitian systems [44, 89]. From numerical perspective, our scalable recipe paves the way for future studies of non-Hermitian inverse problem using matrix product state, tensor network and other computational methods available to the higher dimensions.

      "in [88].\n\n## V Discussion\n\nIn summary, we propose a systematical scheme to reconstruct the non-Hermitian local Hamiltonian from a single pair of biorthogonal eigenstates using generalized quantum covariance matrix. This method is inherited from the quantum covariance matrix in hermitian systems. We apply our method in spin chain with Lee-Yang edge singularity and a non-Hermitian interacting fermion model. The numerical results accurately reproduce the input parent Hamiltonian in both cases. Then we discuss how to extend current approach for further application, including phase expansion, reconstruction for non-degenerate/degenerate biorthogonal eigenstates and detecting local conserved quantities in non-Hermitian systems.\n\nOur proposal answers non-Hermitian quantum inverse problem in a general sense and opens up several new directions of exploring non-Hermitian physics guided by biorthogonal eigenstates. We believe that more novel and meaningful non-Hermitian Hamiltonians could be established and some underlying symmetry could be revealed through our approach. Besides, it will be interesting to reconstruct local entanglement Hamiltonian in non-Hermitian systems using our methods and discover conserved quantities associated with it, in parallel to the work in Hermitian systems [44, 89].\n\nFrom numerical perspective, our scalable recipe paves the way for future studies of non-Hermitian inverse problem using matrix product state, tensor network and other computational methods available to the higher dimensions. The potential of generalized quantum covariance matrix should remain accessible at moderate system sizes.\n\nFrom the experimental side, our work offers a straightforward way to search desired non-Hermitian parent Hamiltonian from controllable interaction. We anticipate it will be pretty meaningful and helpful for the design of non-Hermitian models for experimentalists.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge useful discussions with Qicheng Tang, Xingbo Wei, Yingfei Gu and Zhong Wang.

To obtain the process matrix, we combine the terms and trace out all the environment systems\n\n\\[W=\\mathrm{Tr}_{E 1 ,E 2 ,E 3}(\\rho E_{1}\\otimes T A O E T 1 B I E 2 \u2297 T B O E T 2 C I E 3}), \\tag{8}\\]\n\nwhere \u03c1 E 1 = |0\u27e9 because all qubits on the chip are initialised to the ground state, T A O E 1 B I E 2 = [[ U ]] A O E 1 B I E 2 and T B O E T 2 C I E 3 = [[ U ]] B O E 2 C I E 3 , and [[ U ]] is the Choi form of U, without the partial transposition.\n\n_Choi matrix definition:_ The Choi matrix M A I A O \u2208 L(H A I \u2297 H A O ), isomorphic to a CP map M A : L(H A I ) \u2192 L(H A O ) is defined as M A I A O := [ I \u2297 M ( | 1 \u27e9\u27e9\u27e8 1 | 1 )] T , where I is the identity map, | 1 \u27e9\u27e9 = \u2211 d A I j=1 | jj \u27e9 \u2208 H A I \u2297H A I , {| j \u27e9} d A I j=1 are an orthonormal basis on H A I and T denotes matrix transposition in that basis and some basis of H A O .\n\nWe see that the free evolution, U, depends on the parameters of the Hamiltonian, \u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 , g 1 , 2 , and the time t.

      "showing maximum antibunching and maximum entanglement with Figs 4(a)-(f) and 5(a)-(b), which respectively show efficiency and COP, we will see that there is no correspondence between the maximum of quantum correlations and the maximum of efficiency and COP. As far as the second-order correlation is concerned, the efficiency is higher in the deep strong coupling regime ( \u03bb > 2), Figs. 4(b),(e), and therefore, far from the region where the second-order correlation shows the subPoissonian effect. The same conclusion can be drawn from Fig.5(a)-(c) for the COP, whose maxima lie in regions far from the value of the critical parameter \u03bb. With regard to negativity, Figs.7(b), (d), and (f) show that the maximum of negativity, and therefore of entanglement, does not coincide with the maximum of efficiency and COP. For example, in Fig. 4(b) for T c = 0 . 1 and various values of N, the efficiency is practically constant with the coupling parameter, and therefore independent of the amount of entanglement, whereas in Fig.7(b) the negativity, also at T c = 0 . 1 and the various values of N presents maximums and minimums when varying the coupling parameter. The same can be said about the COP: there is nothing in the analysis of the maximums that indicates the relevance of negativity for its improvement. Take for example Fig.7(d) for T c = 2, where negativity remains zero for a large range of values of \u03bb and then increases monotonically until to \u03bb = 2, with similar behavior even for different values of N. Compare with Fig.5(c), where the COP has a very different behavior depending on N, with no correspondence with negativity. These same conclusions are supported by additional numerical calculations that we performed (not shown here). To summarize this Section, and as previously mentioned, we point out that the improvement in the efficiency and performance of the UQOHM using the Dicke model as the working substance cannot be attributed to quantum resources [99, 100], but it is due to the high anharmonicity of the spectrum around the critical point of the Dicke model.\n\n## V Conclusion\n\nIn summary, in this work we propose a universal quantum Otto heat machine (UQOHM) based on the open Dicke model (ODM).

We identified the boundaries of this semiclassically forbidden region through MonteCarlo sampling of semiclassical spin states (i.e., those states constrained to the surface of the Bloch sphere) followed by gradient descent to the lowest possible energy state. We find that entanglement enables the quantum spins to follow trajectories (through the Bloch sphere interior) that bypass this semiclassical energy barrier. This allows the quantum spin network to reach lower-energy steady-state configurations. Slower ramps could allow the semiclassical trajectories to follow a more adiabatic path back downward to similarly low-energy states. However, we find that such ramps must be at least an orderof-magnitude slower than those considered here. The steady-state energy of the quantum trajectories seems to be primarily controlled by the ramp rate. Evolution through the superradiance transition has the form of a many-body Landau-Zener problem with many-body gaps controlling the adiabatic timescale of the transition. The many-body gap near the transition is on the order of \\(\\omega_{z}\\) for a ferromagnetic ground states. By contrast, spin glasses are characterized by nearly degenerate spin configurations that become exponentially numerous with \\(N\\). This results in much smaller gaps near the transition and nonadiabatic evolution is more likely to occur, as we see in Fig. 4(b). The chosen ramp rate is slow enough to prevent nonadiabatic transitions to highly excited states, but not enough to prevent transitions to the nearly degenerate local minima states. Unitary evolution through the transition then produces an entangled superposition of low-energy states, as seen in Fig. 2, before projection into a single spin state occurs. The final energy of the trajectories is thus controlled by the nonadiabatic transitions experienced during the ramp as well as the measurement projection before \\(\\omega_{z}\\) is ramped to zero. We now explore the emergence of RSB as the system is pumped through the transverse Ising transition. To do so, we first analyze the correlations between independent quantum trajectories of a system with the same quenched disorder for all trajectories. That is, a frustrated spin system with the same \\(J\\) matrix for all trajectory simulations. The replica spin overlap parameter \\(q_{\\alpha\\beta}\\) is defined as [3] \\(q_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\langle\\sigma^{x}_{i\\alpha}\\rangle \\langle\\sigma^{x}_{i\\beta}\\rangle.\\) Here, \\(\\sigma^{x}_{i\\alpha}\\) refers to the Pauli operator for spin index \\(i\\) and replica \\(\\alpha\\), where each replica corresponds to an independent quantum trajectory for a fixed \\(J\\) matrix.

However, the current implementation of quantum computers has an issue with noise, which limits its power. An essential step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing is quantum error correction (QEC), which now becomes one of the key research frontiers in both theoretical studies and hardware developments [ 1 , 2 ] of quantum computation [ 3 ]. In QEC, logical states with \\(k\\) logical qubits are encoded using \\(n\\) physical qubits with redundancy. The effects of continuous errors can be digitalized into a finite set of discrete errors, which can be obtained by measuring the redundant ancilla qubits, giving an error syndrome. Then a decoding algorithm infers the information of errors based on the syndrome and determines an appropriate operation to correct the logical error. However, the decoding problem is a hard problem, for example, it belongs to the class of #P hard problem in the classical error-correcting codes. In quantum codes, decoding is considered to be more challenging than classical code, because the errors inherently degenerate, and the corresponding factor graph for the codes is more complex, for example, in CSS code the factor graph always contains loops with various sizes due to the commutation relations, so standard decoding algorithms such as belief propagation do not work as well as in classical low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. While a number of algorithms have been proposed for decoding quantum error-correcting codes, we lack general decoding algorithms that are efficient and accurate. The minimum weight perfect matching algorithm [ 4 , 5 ] can decode surface code efficiently, however, as a minimumweight decoder ignores the degeneracy of quantum codes, in principle its performance usually has a gap to the theoretical limit. Moreover, it is less efficient in non-planar graphs and is challenging when applied to code on hypergraphs where the distances between two nodes are not well defined. As a prototype of the maximum likelihood decoder (MLD), tensor network methods (e.g. the boundary matrix product state method [ 6 ]) consider the degeneracies of quantum codes and work close to the theoretical limit in surface code. However, for general codes not defined on lattices with open boundaries, the tensor network contractions are difficult to apply due to the large treewidth of the graph. Another issue for existing maximum-likelihood decoders is computing probabilities for \\(4^{k}\\) logical operators for \\(k\\) logical qubits, which is intractable for a large \\(k\\). Moreover, the contraction of tensor networks for each syndrome consumes significantly more computational resources than the minimum"
