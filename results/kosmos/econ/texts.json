Note that the results in cases 1 and 2 are consistent with those of the non-adaptive and path-based multinomial logit (MNL) model. In contrast, in case 3, travelers could not obtain information about the additional travel times before the trip, and they had to adjust their paths locally. Because they globally perceived only *x*1 when they departed from the origin *o*, they originally planned their paths according to the same path probabilities as case 1, resulting in more than half of travelers taking an action to travel link *a*2 that is the first elemental link of path 3 (and paths 4 and 5). However, at the sink node of link *a*2, the travelers locally perceived the additional time of link *a*5 and switched their paths, moving to link *a*3. This local adaption was also observed when travelers move from *a*4 to *a*6, instead of *a*7. As a result, path 5 got the highest probability ( *P*5 = 0.434), followed by path 2 ( *P*2 = 0.268), path 4 ( *P*4 = 0.160), path 1 ( *P*4 = 0.099) and path 3 ( *P*4 = 0.040). This result implies that travelers cannot take the globally optimal path when some attributes are only locally perceived by them. As such, our model can describe both global preferences for and local responses to network attributes through the specifications of decomposed global and local utility functions. Next, to discuss the effect of the size of the scale parameter *\u00b5*G, we computed the path probabilities with different values of *\u00b5*G where *\u00b5* and *\u03b3* are both fixed to one, thereby *\u03b3*\u00b5/*\u00b5*G = 1/*\u00b5*G. The results in Figure 3 (a) show that the probabilities gradually converge to certain values as *\u00b5*G grows. This is because, when *\u00b5*G goes to a sufficiently large value, "

Note that the results in cases 1 and 2 are consistent with those of the non-adaptive and path-based multinomial logit (MNL) model.\n\nIn contrast, in case 3, travelers could not obtain information about the additional travel times before the trip, and they had to adjust their paths locally. Because they globally perceived only *x*1 when they departed from the origin *o*, they originally planned their paths according to the same path probabilities as case 1, resulting in more than half of travelers taking an action to travel link *a*2 that is the first elemental link of path 3 (and paths 4 and 5). However, at the sink node of link *a*2, the travelers locally perceived the additional time of link *a*5 and switched their paths, moving to link *a*3. This local adaption was also observed when travelers move from *a*4 to *a*6, instead of *a*7. As a result, path 5 got the highest probability ( *P*5 = 0.434), followed by path 2 ( *P*2 = 0.268), path 4 ( *P*4 = 0.160), path 1 ( *P*4 = 0.099) and path 3 ( *P*4 = 0.040). This result implies that travelers cannot take the globally optimal path when some attributes are only locally perceived by them. As such, our model can describe both global preferences for and local responses to network attributes through the specifications of decomposed global and local utility functions.\n\nNext, to discuss the effect of the size of the scale parameter *\u00b5*G, we computed the path probabilities with different values of *\u00b5*G where *\u00b5* and *\u03b3* are both fixed to one, thereby *\u03b3*\u00b5/*\u00b5*G = 1/*\u00b5*G. The results in Figure 3(a) show that the probabilities gradually converge to certain values as *\u00b5*G grows. This is because, when *\u00b5*G goes to a sufficiently large value, "

Such complementarities would have relevant and well-known implications for the productivity of heterogeneous vs homogeneous groups (e.g., Prat, 2002), but are not the focus of the present study.\n\n**Action Informativeness** In both example 1 and example 2, the technology views have the property that higher effort is more informative than lower effort, as we show in the appendix. Intuitively, in the bandit problem higher effort increases \\(F(e)\\) the probability of a return, making players subjectively more likely to parse between \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) at the end of the period. In the log-concave noise example, an increase in effort makes the two alternative views' predictions diverge \u2013 so that high output realization becomes stronger evidence in favor of \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) while low output realizations become stronger evidence in favor of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). While 3 is in practice satisfied by many applications (e.g., Keller et al., 2005; Heidhues et al., 2018; Dong, 2018; Ba, 2022), in section 6 we briefly discuss the implications of other relations between the productivity and informativeness of actions, providing an example of a technology that violates assumption 3.\n\n**Different Models and Model Shifts** Three non-standard assumptions about model and model shifts are worth discussing. First, in our model players can agree to disagree on the true model of the world. When they hold different models, Ann sees Bob's model as misspecified \u2013 for instance because based on the wrong hypotheses. Hence, she does not regard it as informative of the true process \\(Q\\). Second, for \\(\\alpha\\) low, the model switch rule LR means that players can agree to disagree on the true model of the world. This is because the true model of the world is misspecified, and the true model of the world is a function of the true model of the world. Third, for \\(\\alpha\\) low, the model switch rule LR means that players can agree to disagree on the true model of the world. This is because the true model of the world is misspecified, and the true model of the world is a function of the true model of the world. Fourth, for \\(\\alpha\\) low, the model switch rule LR means that players can agree to disagree on the true model of the world. This is because the true model of the world is misspecified, and the true model of the world is a function of the true model of the world. Fifth, for \\(\\alpha\\) low, the model switch rule LR means that players can agree to disagree on the true model of the world. This is because the true model of the world is misspecified, and the true model of the world is a function of the true model of the world.

Figure 1 shows the estimated differences in the probability of closure for different baseline levels of government lockdowns. We find that the impact of these lockdowns was strongest at lower baseline levels and diminishes as these levels increase. This suggests that businesses had the most difficulty surviving the initial shock of the lockdowns, while subsequent increases in the severity of these lockdowns had less of an impact.

Figure 1 shows the estimated differences in the probability of closure for different baseline levels of government lockdowns. We find that the impact of these lockdowns was strongest at lower baseline levels and diminishes as these levels increase.

Our paper has two broad implications. First, our methodology of thinking about likelihood ratios can be applied to other settings in which considerations of communication off the equilibrium path are important. In our setup, unlike other models of communication and information design, the design of information structure for the equilibrium level of effort affects off-path communication and the ability of the principal and the agent to capture surplus. This can arise in other settings with strategic information transmission and our method can be useful for that. Second, our paper ties the choice of indicators in contracting to the bargaining power of the parties. In the textbook moral hazard problem, principal makes a take-it-or-leave it offer. As a result, a version of the informativeness principle often holds; the principal wishes to use all the information available, if possible, as contingency for payments. In contrast, in our model, the agent has different incentives for choice of indicators. There are some casual observations that are in line with this explanation. For example, contracts in NFL are often extremely detailed and payments to football players are highly contingent on various measures of individual and team outcomes. In contrast, contracts found in the English Premier League are not as detailed. They are often contingent on very coarse personal outcomes such as the number of goals scored reaching a particular threshold. In light of our theory, the level of competition in English/European soccer (in the form of increased player bargaining power) compared to a lack thereof in NFL could be behind this observation. Future work can hopefully shed light on the importance of this channel in the data.\n\n "

Although accounting for the variance is an appealing property on its own, we also prefer this penalty function as it means the penalization function of the coefficients in the VaR and ES estimation steps is equivalent. Indeed, we rely on the quantile regression estimator of Belloni et al. (2023) (from hereon BCMPW) to obtain the VaR predictions in the first step, although our results apply to any quantile estimator that satisfies the conditions. As financial data is often dependent over time and heavy-tailed, we derive our results under conditions that allow for these properties. Specifically, we allow the data to be \\(\\beta\\)-mixing sequences with finite moments of a certain order. To obtain our results, we develop a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for \\(\\beta\\)-mixing sequences, which may be of independent interest. Using the Fuk-Nagaev inequality we obtain rates on the parameters and penalty parameter that are directly comparable to those for the penalized quantile regression estimator in BCMPW. We apply our method in a systemic risk analysis. In this analysis we generate predictions of the Conditional Expected Shortfall (CoES) to measure the risk spillover from the financial sector to the entire stock market. The CoES measure was introduced in Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) as an extension of CoVaR, an alternative systemic risk measure which is commonly used but is less prudent than CoES from a similar argument to the one that favors ES over VaR. The estimation of CoES relies on three stages of quantile regression and one stage of ES regression. Like Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) we condition on seven lagged fundamental variables, but we extend their set of fundamental variables by also considering nonlinear transformations. Specifically, we use each the Chebyshev polynomials to transform each of the fundamental variables, where the degree of polynomials used may increase with the sample size. Our results show that the penalized VaR and ES estimators outperform the unpenalized benchmark estimator that strictly uses the untransformed set of fundamental variables by a considerable margin in terms of out-of-sample prediction error. We observe that a moderate degree of Chebyshev polynomials is optimal in our sample and generates CoES measurements that are more conservative than the benchmark and more responsive to news. Finally, we observe that the inclusion of nonlinear transformations of the fundamental variables results in a kind of leverage effect: risk predictions are less impacted by positive returns.

The consumer chooses a firm from which to buy, and payoffs are realized. Note that firms share data, and firm A announces its uniform prices, before consumers arrive. After a consumer arrives to the market, the firms who know the consumer\u2019s specific location simultaneously offer personalized prices. If firm A offers a consumer a personalized price, this offer subsumes the firm\u2019s original uniform price. Thus, the uniform price p~A will apply only to those consumers who will not subsequently be offered a personalized price by firm A. Importantly, when firms set personalized prices, they know the uniform price set by firm A in the previous stage. This is the standard timing considered in the literature (see, e.g., [33, 10, 9, 26, 8]). 5 For any fixed mechanism M, we will consider the pure subgame perfect equilibria of the game that starts with data-sharing mechanism M. Such equilibria always exists, and consist of a uniform price for firm A followed by personalized prices for both firms. Once the uniform price is fixed, the equilibrium personalized prices for each consumer. [26] show that, in this case, a (pure) equilibrium may fail to exist. We note that many of our results make no assumptions about the distribution of consumers. In such a general setting there may be multiple equilibria of the game that starts with data-sharing mechanism M. We will be interested in designing mechanisms M that lead to equilibria always exists, and consist of a uniform price for firm A followed by personalized prices for both firms. Once the uniform price is fixed, the equilibrium personalized prices for each consumer are uniquely fixed. We will be interested in designing mechanisms M that lead to equilibria with high firm-profits and high consumer-welfare. One important desideratum of data-sharing mechanisms (with corresponding equilibria) is that they be individually rational (IR): That the expected utility of each firm with data sharing be at least as high as without data sharing. A data-sharing mechanism should be IR if we expect firms to participate. Our main focus will be on mechanisms that are not only IR, but also Pareto-improving: when sharing takes place, (i) the expected utility of each firm and every consumer be at least as high as without data sharing, and that (ii) either firm A\u2019s profits, firm B\u2019s profits, or total consumer welfare be strictly higher. We note that many of our results make no assumptions about the distribution of consumers. In such a general setting there may be multiple equilibria, even with no data-sharing, each with different uniform prices. Hence, we will often describe mechanisms as being IR or Pareto-improving relative to a particular no-sharing equilibrium. We begin by analyzing equilibria under no data-sharing. To this end, define \u00b5(p~A) = 1/2 - p~A/2t. If firm A charges uniform price p~A, then the consumer located at \u00b5(p~A) is indifferent between purchasing from firm A at that price and purchasing from firm B at price 0. All consumers located to the left of \u00b5(p~A) will thus strictly prefer purchasing from firm A at price p~A than from firm B at any nonnegative price.

This allows us to apply our duality results in Section 3 to evaluate and compare \\(\\Theta_{\\text{D}}(\\delta)\\) and \\(\\Theta(\\delta)\\).\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{D}}(\\delta)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{I}(\\delta)\\) denote the upper bounds of \\(\\Theta_{\\text{D}}(\\delta)\\) and \\(\\Theta(\\delta)\\), respectively, where\n\n\\[\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{D}}(\\delta)=\\sup_{\\gamma\\in\\Sigma_{\\text{D}}(\\delta)}\\int_ {\\mathcal{Y}_{1}\\times\\mathcal{Y}_{2}}f(y_{1},y_{2})\\,d\\gamma(y_{1},y_{2}) \\text{ and }\\mathcal{I}(\\delta)=\\sup_{\\gamma\\in\\Sigma(\\delta)}\\int_{\\mathcal{ S}}f(y_{1},y_{2})\\,d\\gamma(y_{1},y_{2},x).\\]\n\nProposition 4.1 establishes robust versions of existing results on the identified sets of treatment effects under Assumption 2.4, see Fan et al.

      "di\ufb00erence in belief between the cutoff belief for the first-best and the cutoff in any MPE). Changing \u03bb scales the noncooperative game and the first-best solution identically and hence also has no impact on efficiency. More notably, the efficiency condition is independent of R w and \u03c0 w; that is, the condition for efficiency does not depend on what the winner receives. To understand this, consider an incremental increase in R w or \u03c0 w, fixing R l and \u03c0 l. Any incremental increase induces agents in the noncooperative game to experiment more but also induces more experimentation in the social planner problem. To understand why this does not affect the efficiency implications, consider the best-response problem of agent i. For agent i, the cumulative effort of other agents K \u2212 i brings about a \u201closs\u201d event at a rate of \u03bbK \u2212 i , but agent i has no agency over the effort of the other agents. Instead, the effort choice for agent i weighs the relative benefit of winning versus the status quo project (and in fact, b I and c I have no R l , \u03c0 l dependence). Hence, in the noncooperative game, agents are intuitively already trading off the relative benefits of winning versus the status quo in an efficient manner; however, they do not properly account for the externalities induced by their research effort on other players. Thus, the source of any potential inefficiency is the extent to which the externalities harm or help the other agents. The next subsection outlines the technical steps to prove Theorem 2.

Changing \u03bb scales the noncooperative game and the first-best solution identically and hence also has no impact on e\ufb03ciency.\n\nMore notably, the e\ufb03ciency condition is independent of R w and \u03c0 w; that is, the condition for e\ufb03ciency does not depend on what the winner receives. To understand this, consider an incremental increase in R w or \u03c0 w, fixing R l and \u03c0 l. Any incremental increase induces agents in the noncooperative game to experiment more but also induces more experimentation in the social planner problem. To understand why this does not a\ufb00ect the e\ufb03ciency implications, consider the best-response problem of agent i. For agent i, the cumulative effort of other agents K \u2212 i brings about a \u201closs\" event at a rate of \u03bbK \u2212 i , but agent i has no agency over the effort of the other agents. Instead, the effort choice for agent i weighs the relative benefit of winning versus the status quo project (and in fact, b I and c I have no R l , \u03c0 l dependence). Hence, in the noncooperative game, agents are intuitively already trading o\ufb00 the relative benefits of winning versus the status quo in an efficient manner; however, they do not properly account for the externalities induced by their research effort on other players. Thus, the source of any potential ine\ufb03ciency is the extent to which the externalities harm or help the other agents.\n\nThe next subsection outlines the technical steps to prove Theorem 2.

We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following Eloundou et al. (2023)'s methodology. We then aggregate occupation exposure to the industry level to obtain industry exposure scores. The results indicate a positive correlation between occupation exposure and wage levels/experience premiums, suggesting higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater displacement risks from LLM-powered software. The industry exposure scores align with expert assessments and economic intuitions. We also develop an economic growth model incorporating industry exposure to quantify the productivity-employment trade-off from AI adoption. Overall, this study provides an analytical basis for understanding the labor market impacts of increasingly capable AI systems in China. Key innovations include the occupation-level exposure analysis, industry aggregation approach, and economic modeling incorporating AI adoption and labor market effects.

We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following Eloundou et al. (2023)'s methodology. We then aggregate occupation exposure to the industry level to obtain industry exposure scores. The results indicate a positive correlation between occupation exposure and wage levels/experience premiums, suggesting higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater displacement risks from LLM-powered software. The industry exposure scores align with expert assessments and economic intuitions. We also develop an economic growth model incorporating industry exposure to quantify the productivity-employment trade-off from AI adoption. Overall, this study provides an analytical basis for understanding the labor market impacts of increasingly capable AI systems in China. Key innovations include the occupation-level exposure analysis, industry aggregation approach, and economic modeling incorporating AI adoption and labor market effects. The findings will inform policymakers and businesses on strategies for maximizing the benefits of AI while mitigating adverse disruption risks.\n\n1MetroData\n\nShanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory2\n\nFudan University3\n\nqinchen1986@hotmail.com, {gejinfeng,xiehuaqing}@pjlab.org.cn,\n\nxingcheng.xu18@gmail.com, yanqingyang@fudan.edu.cn\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe recent remarkable progress in the field of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) (Bubeck et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) has provoke many pressing questions about the effects of these powerful technologies on the economy.

Since the stock accumulation is slow in our example, prices converge to their long-run values from below without overshooting, but overshooting is possible. After 4 years, prices have converged to their long-run values, so the only driver of stock increase is the convergence of interest rate to its long-run average. Stock levels present a different sensitivity to storage costs and demand elasticity. Stocks decrease more with an increase in interest rate when storage costs are lower, because for lower physical storage costs, stock levels are higher on average and more sensitive to variation in the opportunity costs. Stocks decrease less for a more inelastic demand. This is explained by the fact that with a more inelastic demand, a small increase of sales from inventory depresses prices much more, limiting the incentives to sell too much from the stocks. The right panels of Figure 5 displays the IRFs for price volatility, namely, the conditionally expected standard deviation of price.22 It shows that price volatility mostly follows stock dynamics with a peak attained after a year and an incomplete convergence after 4 years.

These results match the empirical results of Gruber and Vigfusson ( 2018) who show that higher interest rates imply higher price volatility.\n\nFootnote 22: Mathematically, the price volatility is defined here as the square root of the conditional variance: \\(\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}_{t-1}[f^{\\ast}(X_{t},Z_{t})]^{2}-[\\mathbb{E}_{t-1}f^{\\ast}(X_{ t},Z_{t})]^{2}}\\).\n\nFigure 6: Contemporaneous IRFs (in percentage points) to a 25 bp interest rate shock for various parameters and realized states\n\n"

      "tive effect for women (columns (1) to (4)), suggesting a reduced probability of encountering gender discrimination.\n\nThe empirical findings presented in Tables III to V provide support for the following narrative: exposure to high school courses on the 1991 Colombian Constitution is associated with a more favorable attitude towards gender equality, particularly among men. Furthermore, it leads to a diminished perception of sex discrimination, particularly among women. These findings suggest that the hypothesized change in social norms primarily involves altering men\u2019s attitudes towards gender equality. This shift in stance may have contributed to women perceiving reduced instances of sex discrimination and experiencing increased participation in the labor market (as indicated in Tables I and II). This hypothesis, while broadly formulated, aligns with specific aspects of Colombian culture, notably the prevailing male-dominated labor market where women are often relegated to the domestic sphere (Iregui-Boh\u00b4orquez et al. , 2020). Furthermore, this hypothesis is in line with the idea put forth by ?\u2019s that promoting women\u2019s rights requires men to have incentives to share power with women.\n\n### Work and Home Spheres\n\nIn the preceding subsection, we briefly discussed the role of men in facilitating the transformation of social norms that affected women\u2019s participation in the labor market. However, we need to provide more clarity on this matter. In this subsection, we will delve deeper into this topic by addressing the following questions: Which women are the beneficiaries of men\u2019s most favorable views on gender equality? Are these views limited to women residing within the households of these men (e.g., their wives or daughters)? Or do they extend to women beyond their immediate households? Although the analysis in this subsection is exploratory in nature and the results are presented at a broader level, they provide valuable insights into the specific mechanisms underlying our main findings.\n\nIn Table VI, we examine whether women\u2019s increased labor market participation, resulting from exposure to high school courses on the 1991 Colombian Constitution, can be attributed to their male partners\u2019 more favorable attitude towards gender equality.12 The estimates reveal no statistically significant difference between women who have partners supportive of gender equality (columns (1) to (4)) and those without such partners (columns (5) to (8)). This suggests that women\u2019s increased participation in the labor market is unlikely due to greater support or fewer barriers imposed by their male partners.13\n\nFootnote 12: It is important to note that the attitude of an individual\u2019s partner towards gender equality can be influenced by the treatment, making this variable a \u201cbad control.\u201d Therefore, the interpretation of these results should be exercised with caution.\n\nFootnote 13: The estimates presented in Table A1 in Appendix A.1 further support these findings, indicating that exposure to high school courses on the 1991 Colombian Constitution increase men\u2019s awareness of gender equality regardless of their role as household heads.\n\n "

      "Flexible heat pumps: must-have or nice to have in a power sector with renewables?\n\nAlexander Roth, Dana Kirchem, Carlos Gaete-Morales, Wolf-Peter Schill\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n**Abstract**\n\nHeat pumps are a key technology for reducing fossil fuel use in the heating sector. A transition to heat pumps implies an increase in electricity demand, especially in cold winter months. Using an open-source power sector model, we examine the power sector impacts of a massive expansion of decentralized heat pumps in Germany in 2030, combined with buffer heat storage of different sizes. Assuming that the additional electricity used by heat pumps has to be fully covered by renewable energies in a yearly balance, we quantify the required additional investments in renewable energy sources. If wind power expansion potentials are limited, the roll-out of heat pumps can also be accompanied by solar PV with little additional costs, making use of the European interconnection. The need for additional firm capacity and electricity storage generally remains limited even in the case of temporally inflexible heat pumps. We further find that relatively small heat storage capacities of 2 to 6 hours can substantially reduce the need for short- and long-duration electricity storage and other generation capacities, as well as power sector costs. We further show that 5.8 million additional heat pumps save around 120 TWh of natural gas and 24 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nIn light of the climate crisis, heat pumps are regarded as a central technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the heating sector [10]. When powered with electricity from renewable energy sources (RES), heat pumps can displace traditional heating technologies such as oil- and gas-fired heating and thus mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to a further political push in Europe, but especially Germany, to reduce the dependence on Russian natural gas imports. In Germany, natural gas is, at the moment, still the principal source of residential heating. The electrification of heating can therefore be seen as a critical measure to reduce the use of natural gas.\n\nIn Germany, policymakers aim for an accelerated roll-out of decentralized heat pumps, with a declared target of six million installed heat pumps by the year 2030 [15]. Given the current stock of around 1.5 million heat pumps, such a transition implies an increase in the electricity demand. So far, it is not yet understood how an increased heat pump stock affects the power sector in detail, considering that the electricity needs for mobility, hydrogen production, and other energy services will also increase. One common concern is that heat pumps constitute an additional burden on the power sector if they are operated in an inflexible manner. Given that electricity load profiles often coincide with heat demand profiles, inflexible heat pumps could add to existing load peaks and thus increase the need for firm generation capacity or electricity storage.

      "\n\n**Optimizing Network Traffic Patterns** In order to find chances for cost reductions, it is essential to examine the network traffic patterns inside a cloud environment. Enterprises may optimize their network infrastructure and cut expenses by looking at the amount and kind of data flows using network traffic analysis. Enterprises can use monitoring tools and analytics platforms offered by cloud providers or third-party solutions to do network traffic analysis. These tools give users insight into the patterns of network traffic, including data transfer rates, peak usage periods, and the types of data being transferred [30]. Enterprises can find potential areas for optimization with the use of this information. For instance, they can discover data-intensive programs or services that cause a lot of network traffic and look for ways to improve how data is transferred between them. This may entail putting data compression techniques into practice, leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs) or edge caching to shorten the distances between data transfers, or using data deduplication techniques to stop repeated transfers. In order to maximize network efficiency, network traffic analysis can also help find opportunities for traffic rerouting or load balancing. Enterprises can lower bandwidth consumption and possibly lower data transfer costs by intelligently directing traffic through efficient channels or dispersing it across numerous network resources. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Edge Caching** Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) play a key role in improving network performance and lowering costs. When using CDNs, content can be delivered from the edge location that is closest to the end users by utilizing edge servers that are dispersed across different locations. The usage of CDNs, edge caching, and traffic control strategies to save costs and boost overall network effectiveness are examined in this section. By caching and distributing content closer to end users, CDNs aim to lower latency and boost speed. CDNs reduce the distance that data must travel across the network by strategically distributing content in geographically dispersed edge servers. By serving content from edge locations rather than the origin server, this not only improves the user experience but also lowers network egress costs. Frequently accessed content is stored at edge server locations as part of the edge caching approach. The content is delivered directly from the nearest edge cache when a user wants it, avoiding the need for data to travel across the entire network. Enterprises may drastically lower network egress costs and enhance end-user response times by utilizing edge caching. Additionally, by offloading the traffic from the origin server to the edge locations, enterprises can lessen the stress on the origin server, increase network bandwidth, and lower egress costs by dumping data closer to the end users. As a result, less expensive origin server resources and data transfer are not required for serving static content.

Let L\u2019 = \\(\\{l_{a}\\in L:l_{a}\\cap((T\\setminus J)\\cup R)\\neq\\emptyset\\}\\). Moreover, let J* = J \\(\\cap\\) T*. Then we will show that there exists a replacement set R* for J* such that \\(|R*\\leq|J*\\|\\) and \\(\\sigma_{0}((T*\\setminus J*)\\cup R*)-\\sigma_{0}((T\\setminus J)\\cup R)\\leq 2/h\\).\n\nWe construct the set R* as follows. Consider a cell l~a \u2208 L\u2019. Since l~a \\(\\cap((T\\setminus J)\\cup R)\\neq\\emptyset\\), l~a is nonempty. This implies T* \\(\\cap l~a \\neq\\emptyset\\) from the way we construct T*. Let c~a be the only candidate in T* \\(\\cap l~a\\). If c~a \u2208 J, then we replace c~a with an arbitrary c~a' \u2208 l~a \\(\\setminus J\\) (i.e., we add c~a' to R*). We know that such a candidate c~a' exists because l~a \\(\\cap((T\\setminus J)\\cup R)\\neq\\emptyset\\). Since we only add a candidate to R* from l~a such that J* \\(\\cap l~a \\neq\\emptyset\\), we have \\(|R*\\leq|J*\\|\\).\n\nWe will now show that \\(\\sigma_{0}((T*\\setminus J*)\\cup R*)-\\sigma_{0}((T\\setminus J)\\cup R)\\leq 2/h\\). Observe that for a pair of candidates c~1, c~2 \u2208 l~a, d(c~1, c~2) \\(\\leq 2/h\\) (see Figure 4). Let C~a = l~a \\(\\cap((T\\setminus J)\\cup R)\\). Moreover, let V~a \u2286 V be the set of voters which have a candidate in C~a as their closest candidate in the committee (T \\(\\setminus J)\\cup R\\). Using the triangle inequality, we know that d(V~a, c~a') \\(\\leq d(V~a, C~a) + 2/h\\). The above statement holds for all cells l~a \u2208 L\u2019. Therefore, \\(\\sigma_{0}((T*\\setminus J*)\\cup R*)-\\sigma_{0}((T\\setminus J)\\cup R)\\leq 2/h\\).\n\nNote that our proof works for an arbitrary failing set J including J = \\(\\emptyset\\). This completes the proof of Lemma 29. \\(\\blacktriangleleft\\)\n\nBased on the above observation, we solve the problem as follows. We enumerate all maps \\(\\chi:L\\to\\{0,1,\\ldots,h^{4}\\}\\) where \\(\\chi(l~a)\\) is the number of candidates from l~a in the committee. The total number of such maps is \\(h^{O(h^{4})}\\). For each feasible map, i.e., \\(\\chi\\) satisfying \\(\\chi(l~a)\\) \\(\\in|C\\cap l~a|\\) for all a \u2208 \\([h^{4}]\\), we construct a fault-tolerant committee T*~\u03c7 for V~i,j by picking (arbitrarily) \\(\\chi(l~a)\\) candidates in C \\(\\cap l~a\\) for all a \u2208 \\([h^{4}]\\) and including them in T*.~\u03c7.

[ 7 ]. In words, (unregularized) PCR \u201cdenoises\u201d the observed covariates by projecting them onto the subspace given by their k -truncation, before estimating \u03b8 ( a ) via linear regression using the projected covariates. We the sequel, we only consider adaptive PCR with truncation level k = r . We now introduce the concept of signal to noise ratio, which will be integral in stating and proving our results. The signal to noise ratio provides a measure of how strongly the true covariates (this is the \u201csignal\u201d of the problem, measured through \u03c3 r ( X n ( a )) ) stand out sequentially with respect to the \u201cnoise\u201d induced by E n (which we will measure through the relevant high probability bounds on \u2225E n \u2225 op ). We define the signal to noise ratio associated with an action a \u2208 [ A ] at round n as \\[\\text{snr}_{n}(a):=\\frac{\\sigma_{r}(\\mathbf{X}_{n}(a))}{U_{n}},\\] where ( U n ) n \u2265 1 is a noise-dependent sequence growing as U n = O ( \u221a n + \u221a d + \\sqrt{\\log\\left(1\\over\\delta\\log(n)\\right)}\\right).\\] The price we pay for adaptivity is encoded directly into the definition of the signal to noise ratio, snr n ( a ) . While one may imagine defining snr n ( a ) as the ratio between \u03c3 r ( X n ( a )) and \u2225E n ( a ) \u2225 op , bounding \u2225E n ( a ) \u2225 op is a nontrivial task as the rows of E n ( a ) may be strongly correlated. To circumvent this, we apply the trivial bound \u2225E n ( a ) \u2225 op \u2264 \u2225E n \u2225 op . Thus, the price of adaptivity in our setting is that the signal from covariates associated with an action a must stand out with respect to the total covariate noise by time n . The growth condition on U n presented in Definition 3.5 is motivated as follows: w.h.p E \u2225E n \u2225 op \u2248 \u221a d + \u221a n , and the extra additive \\(\\sqrt{\\log "

      "tackled using inverse probability weighting methods. Since there are various types of reserves in general insurance, in this section we provide the overall idea of the methodology for the total reserve of outstanding claims only. Section 3 will delve into the specific details of the methodology for the most prevalent and significant reserves in general insurance, namely RBNS and IBNR reserves.\n\n### The claim reserving problem\n\nSuppose an insurance company is analyzing its total liabilities associated with claims whose accident times occur between \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=\\tau\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is the valuation time of analysis as defined by the actuary. In general insurance, accidents are often not immediately reported to the insurance company for various reasons, resulting in a significant delay between the occurrence of a claimable accident and the time the insurance company is notified. Therefore, at a given valuation time \\(\\tau\\), the insurance company only has information on the claims reported by \\(\\tau\\) and is unaware of the unreported claims. Furthermore, the complexity of the problem increases due to another delay in the payment process. When a claim is reported, it is common for it to be paid in several subpayments over time rather than as a lump sum. This is because the impact of an accident can evolve, requiring additional payments until it is fully settled. Therefore, at a given valuation time \\(\\tau\\), the insurance company is only aware of the claims that were reported on time, and for each one, it may have paid only a partial amount of the associated claim size, rather than the entire amount.\n\nAs a result, the insurance company is interested in estimating the total claim amount of these unreported claims, as well as the remaining payments of the reported claims, to construct the overall reserve of outstanding claims. This reserve is also known in the insurance jargon as the Incurred But Not Settled (IBNS), and it\u2019s usually decomposed into further subcomponents depending on whether the payment is associated with a reported or not reported claim. For simplicity, here we consider the estimation of the overall reserve of outstanding claims without referring to the components.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s describe the payment process as follows:\n\n* Let \\(N(\\tau)\\) represent the total number of different payments associated with all the claims whose accident time is before the valuation time \\(\\tau\\).\n* Let \\(Y_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence payments. Note that some payments may belong to the same claim/accident, but we will not make any distinction.\n* Let \\(T_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence of accident times associated with the claim underlying each payment; let \\(R_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence of the associated reporting times; let \\(S_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence of the associated times in which the payments take place. Clearly, \\(T_{i}&lt;R_{i}&lt;S_{i}\\) and note that the values \\(T_{i},R_{i}\\) would be the same for payments associated with the same claim, but the \\(S_{i}\\) would differ.\n* Let \\(U_{i}=R_{i}-T_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) be the sequence of the reporting delay times associated with the claim underlying each payment, and \\(V_{i}=S_{i}-R_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) be the sequence of the associated payment delay time of each payment. Note that \\(U_{i}\\) is the same for all the payments associated with the same claim.\n* Let \\(X_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) be the sequence of information/attributes of relevance, that is associated with the accident, the type of claim, the policyholder attributes, or the characteristics of the payment itself.\n* Let \\(N^{P}(\\tau)\\) the number of payments made by valuation time \\(\\tau\\) out of the total \\(N(\\tau)\\) i.e the number of payments made to the claims reported by \\(\\tau\\).\n\n "

Section 3 will delve into the specific details of the methodology for the most prevalent and significant reserves in general insurance, namely RBNS and IBNR reserves.\n\n### The claim reserving problem\n\nSuppose an insurance company is analyzing its total liabilities associated with claims whose accident times occur between \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=\\tau\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is the valuation time of analysis as defined by the actuary. In general insurance, accidents are often not immediately reported to the insurance company for various reasons, resulting in a significant delay between the occurrence of a claimable accident and the time the insurance company is notified. Therefore, at a given valuation time \\(\\tau\\), the insurance company only has information on the claims reported by \\(\\tau\\) and is unaware of the unreported claims. Furthermore, the complexity of the problem increases due to another delay in the payment process. When a claim is reported, it is common for it to be paid in several subpayments over time rather than as a lump sum. This is because the impact of an accident can evolve, requiring additional payments until it is fully settled. Therefore, at a given valuation time \\(\\tau\\), the insurance company is only aware of the claims that were reported on time, and for each one, it may have paid only a partial amount of the associated claim size, rather than the entire amount.\n\nAs a result, the insurance company is interested in estimating the total claim amount of these unreported claims, as well as the remaining payments of the reported claims, to construct the overall reserve of outstanding claims. This reserve is also known in the insurance jargon as the Incurred But Not Settled (IBNS), and it\u2019s usually decomposed into further subcomponents depending on whether the payment is associated with a reported or not reported claim. For simplicity, here we consider the estimation of the overall reserve of outstanding claims without referring to the components.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s describe the payment process as follows:\n\n* Let \\(N(\\tau)\\) represent the total number of different payments associated with all the claims whose accident time is before the valuation time \\(\\tau\\).\n* Let \\(Y_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence payments. Note that some payments may belong to the same claim/accident, but we will not make any distinction.\n* Let \\(T_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence of accident times associated with the claim underlying each payment; let \\(R_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence of the associated reporting times; let \\(S_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) denote the sequence of the associated times in which the payments take place. Clearly, \\(T_{i}&lt;R_{i}&lt;S_{i}\\) and note that the values \\(T_{i},R_{i}\\) would be the same for payments associated with the same claim, but the \\(S_{i}\\) would differ.\n* Let \\(U_{i}=R_{i}-T_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) be the sequence of the reporting delay times associated with the claim underlying each payment, and \\(V_{i}=S_{i}-R_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) be the sequence of the associated payment delay time of each payment. Note that \\(U_{i}\\) is the same for all the payments associated with the same claim.\n* Let \\(X_{i}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,N(\\tau)\\) be the sequence of information/attributes of relevance, that is associated with the accident, the type of claim, the policyholder attributes, or the characteristics of the payment itself.\n* Let \\(N^{P}(\\tau)\\) the number of payments made by valuation time \\(\\tau\\) out of the total \\(N(\\tau)\\) i.e the number of payments made to the claims reported by \\(\\tau\\).\n\n "

This includes not relying solely on LLMs for critical decisions, being cautious about potential biases in the training data, and understanding the ethical implications of using LLMs.\n\n5. Human-Machine Collaboration: Social norms are evolving to promote collaboration between humans and LLMs. Users understand that LLMs can be valuable tools for information retrieval, idea generation, and learning. The norm is to view LLMs as partners rather than replacements, leveraging their strengths while recognizing the irreplaceable role of human creativity, empathy, and critical thinking.\n\n6.

Consequently, users are encouraged to provide additional context or clarification to ensure accurate and relevant responses.\n\n4. Responsible Use: As LLMs become more prevalent, there is a growing awareness of the importance of responsible use. This includes not relying solely on LLMs for critical decisions, being cautious about potential biases in the training data, and understanding the ethical implications of using LLMs.\n\n5. Human-Machine Collaboration: Social norms are evolving to promote collaboration between humans and LLMs. Users understand that LLMs can be valuable tools for information retrieval, idea generation, and learning. The norm is to view LLMs as partners rather than replacements, leveraging their strengths while recognizing the irreplaceable role of human creativity, empathy, and critical thinking.\n\n6. Privacy and Data Protection: Norms around privacy and data protection apply to interactions with LLMs as well. Users expect that their personal information and interactions "

Interestingly, for students with the latter two next-best alternatives, it also decreases the probability to graduate from any program. For students whose next-best alternative is Science & Engineering at UChile, the naive estimate indicates a small negative effect on graduation from any program while our bounds show that this effect cannot be signed and may be 50 times larger in magnitude. Bounds do suggest that admission to Business Administration at PUC Santiago has a negative effect on reapplication for these students. While we generally see magnitudes of 0.1 or 0.2 in the effects on graduation from Business Administration or any program, we see much smaller magnitudes on the students\u2019 probability to graduate from a STEM program \u2014which is reassuring given that our definition of STEM does not include Business Administration.

For convenience, we take the continuous time and continuous space limit, following the common procedure to obtain a mean-field description of exclusion processes on lattices (see e.g. [44]). The average occupation number \\(\\langle n\\rangle\\) is now described by the density \\(\\rho\\), while the spatially smoothed average occupation number \\(\\langle\\tilde{n}\\rangle\\) is described by the field \\(\\varphi\\equiv G_{\\sigma}\\ast\\rho\\). The master equation for the occupation probability then takes the form of a noiseless hydrodynamic equation, in our case: equationparentequation\n\n\\[\\partial_{t}\\rho(x,t)=[1-\\rho(x,t)]\\int{\\rm d}y\\,\\rho(y,t)w([\\varphi],y,x,t) \\tag{15}\\]\n\nwith the transition rate from \\(y\\) to \\(x\\) explicitly given by\n\n\\[w([\\varphi],y,x,t)=\\omega f\\left[u(\\varphi(x,t))-u(\\varphi(y,t))\\right], \\tag{16}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is homogeneous to an inverse time scale. Eq. (15) is valid in any dimension, but, for simplicity, we will work out the mean-field computations in dimension 1 in space. This can be justified _a posteriori_ when we compare the mean-field (MF) to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Let us also mention that the dimension does not play a role in determining the phase densities in the steady state of coarse-grained field theories (Allen-Cahn [45], Cahn-Hilliard [46], etc.). Integrating Eq. (15) over space, one immediately sees that the total density \\(\\int\\rho\\) is conserved. One can also check that in the very specific case where \\(u(\\varphi)\\) is linear in \\(\\varphi\\), one can build a free-energy functional that is a Lyapunov function of the non-local MF dynamics, ensuring a convergence towards local minima and preventing limit cycles and oscillatory dynamics. This is a natural consequence of the fact that detailed balance is satisfied at microscopic level. In App. C, we construct this free energy and show that the dynamics is relaxational. B. Linear stability analysis In the general case, we would like to understand how the homogeneous state becomes unstable. To do so, we consider a small perturbation around the homogeneous state: \\(\\rho(x,t)=\\rho_{0}+\\rho_{1}(x,t)\\), with \\(\\rho_{1}\\) the perturbation.

For convenience, we take the continuous time and continuous space limit, following the common procedure to obtain a mean-field description of exclusion processes on lattices (see e.g. [44]). The average occupation number \\(\\langle n\\rangle\\) is now described by the density \\(\\rho\\), while the spatially smoothed average occupation number \\(\\langle\\tilde{n}\\rangle\\) is described by the field \\(\\varphi\\equiv G_{\\sigma}\\ast\\rho\\). The master equation for the occupation probability then takes the form of a noiseless hydrodynamic equation, in our case:\n\n\\[\\partial_{t}\\rho(x,t)=[1-\\rho(x,t)]\\int{\\rm d}y\\,\\rho(y,t)w([\\varphi],y,x,t) \\tag{15}\\]\n\nwith the transition rate from \\(y\\) to \\(x\\) explicitly given by\n\n\\[w([\\varphi],y,x,t)=\\omega f\\left[u(\\varphi(x,t))-u(\\varphi(y,t))\\right], \\tag{16}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is homogeneous to an inverse time scale. Eq. (15) is valid in any dimension, but, for simplicity, we will work out the mean-field computations in dimension 1 in space. This can be justified _a posteriori_ when we compare the mean-field (MF) to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Let us also mention that the dimension does not play a role in determining the phase densities in the steady state of coarse-grained field theories (Allen-Cahn [45], Cahn-Hilliard [46], etc.).\n\nIntegrating Eq. (15) over space, one immediately sees that the total density \\(\\int\\rho\\) is conserved. One can also check that in the very specific case where \\(u(\\varphi)\\) is linear in \\(\\varphi\\), one can build a free-energy functional that is a Lyapunov function of the non-local MF dynamics, ensuring a convergence towards local minima and preventing limit cycles and oscillatory dynamics. This is a natural consequence of the fact that detailed balance is satisfied at microscopic level. In App. C, we construct this free energy and show that the dynamics is relaxational.\n\n### Linear stability analysis\n\nIn the general case, we would like to understand how the homogeneous state becomes unstable. To do so, we consider a small perturbation around the homogeneous state: \\(\\rho(x,t)=\\rho_{0}+\\rho_{1}(x,t)\\), with \\(\\rho_{1}\\) the perturbation. By linearity of the convolution, one has \\(\\varphi(x,t)=\\rho_{0}+\\varphi_{1}(x,t)\\), with \\(\\varphi_{1}\\equiv G_{\\sigma}\\ast\\rho_{1}\\). A Taylor expansion of Eq. (15) combined with mass conservation (i.e \\(\\int_{D}\\rho_{1}=\\int_{D}\\varphi_{1}=0\\), where \\(D\\) is the full domain), finally yields:\n\n\\[\\partial_{t}\\rho(x,t)=2\\Omega\\rho_{0}(1-\\rho_{0})f^{\\prime}(0)u^{\\prime}(\\rho_{0 })\\varphi_{1}(x,t) \\tag{17}\\]\n\nwith \u2126 the full domain size. Defining the Fourier transform for any field h as \\(\\hat{h}(k)=\\int{\\rm d}x\\,e^{-ikx}h(x)\\), one obtains\n\n\\[\\partial_{t}\\hat{\\rho}_{1}(k,t)=\\Lambda(k)\\hat{\\rho}_{1}(k "

While some commodity price movements are driven by idiosyncratic shocks to supply and demand,1 other commodity price movements are driven by aggregate factors, such as aggregate demand and monetary conditions. The role of aggregate factors in driving commodity prices is well recognized in the literature. Alquist et al. (2020) show that up to 80% of the variance of commodity prices is explained by common factors (see also Byrne et al., 2013). However, the precise channels of transmission are less well identified.\n\nFootnote 1: For example, the price of lithium spiked in early 2021 when US President Biden announced a plan to build 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles. In the same period, the price of rubber fell as a shortage in microchip supply for vehicle makers drove forecasts for a reduction in tire demand.\n\nIn this paper, we contribute to the debate on the role of aggregate factors in commodity prices through a focus on interest rate shocks and various important channels. Empirical analysis of this question confront profound challenges, because of endogeneity and the general equilibrium nature of some of the mechanisms: interest rate movements are determined by several macroeconomic variables that also affect commodity markets,2 and conversely, pure monetary shocks affect commodity markets through various channels (e.g., speculation, aggregate demand, and supply reaction) that may not be disentangled empirically.3 A structural model is required to isolate the direct effect of interest rates on commodity prices through each of these channels.\n\nFootnote 2: One of these confounding factors is the output. For example, a low aggregate output (recession) might cause both falling commodity prices and a reduction in interest rates by the monetary authority. Even if we fully control for changes in output and demand, rising commodity prices might themselves trigger a tightening of monetary policy, without any change in output (see, e.g., Cody and Mills, 1991).\n\nFootnote 3: For example, a decline in the US interest rate can stimulate both global demand (see, e.g., Ramey, 2016) and firms\u2019 incentive to hold inventories (see, e.g., Frankel, 1986, 2008, 2014), which then increase commodity prices. An increase in interest rates works in the opposite direction.\n\nThe obvious candidate to provide the required structure is the rational expectations competitive storage model, which has been developed, among others, by Samuelson (1971), Newbery and Stiglitz (1982), Wright and Williams (1982), Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983), Deaton and Laroque (1992, 1996), and Chambers and Bailey (1996).4 In this model, commodities are assets that also have intrinsic value, separate from future cash flows.

      "Loder et al.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nIn response to the 2022 cost-of-living crisis in Europe, the German government introduced a threemonth fuel excise tax cut and a public transport season ticket for 9 Euro per month, valid on all local and regional services, the so-called \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d. The latter can be considered almost fare-free public transport. The selected months were June, July, and August, i.e., a period characterized by summer holidays. Given the critical role of travel costs in mode choice ( 1 ), this natural experiment was expected to lead to a modal shift to public transport because the season ticket price cut was so substantial. In addition, many expected that the almost fare-free aspect of the \u201c9-EuroTicket\u201d leads to high levels of induced demand. The success of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d prompted an immediate discussion as well as public and political demand for introducing a successor ticket to the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d as soon as possible. This ticket, the so-called \u201cDeutschlandticket\u201d, was finally introduced in May 2023. We set up the \u201cMobilit\u00e4t.Leben\u201d study to observe this fare policy innovation using questionnaires and GPS tracking to generate travel diaries ( 2 , 3 ). This behavioral intervention, which could be one of the largest public transport pricing travel behavior experiments, has been studied by many: all of them reported a substantial increase in public transport usage during the validity period of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d and a return to almost pre-ticket levels after the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d validity period ( 2 , 4 \u2013 7 ). The official and main study was conducted by Association of German Transport Companies, which surveyed more than 200,000 people in Germany ( 4 ): around 20% of all \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d customers were new customers to public transport. Out of all public transport trips in the months of June, July, and August 2022, 17% of trips have been shifted from other transport modes, and 10% of trips have been shifted from the car to public transport, in rural areas, even 13 to 16%. 16% of all trips correspond to induced demand. In addition, trip distances increased by 38% during the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d period. Another survey showed that 11% of all trips conducted during the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d period shifted from other modes of transport, while 6% of all trips were induced ( 6 ). Using surveys and GPS tracking, another study concluded that the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d did not lead to a change in daily mobility but instead increased leisure travel at the beginning and the end of the ticket\u2019s validity period, leaving monetary savings as the main effect of the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d ( 5 ). Generally, the summer months of June, July, and August usually see less ridership due to the summer holidays, but in 2022 this trend was reversed ( 7 ). For the \u201cDeutschlandticket\u201d, first results for the Hamburg metropolitan area suggest that season-ticket ownership increased by 22 % and ridership increased from 89.3 % to 95.4 % of the pre-pandemic levels from April to May 2023 ( 8 ). The dominant methodological approach was a cross-sectional survey with online questionnaires and interviews ( 4 , 6 , 7 ), and panel studies ( 9 , 10 ). Both are established survey techniques in transport research, also for nationwide household travel surveys ( 11 \u2013 14 ). The complexity of the fare-policy innovation with the \u201c9-Euro-Ticket\u201d and the \u201cDeutschlandticket\u201d, however, means that travel behavior changes can result, which are difficult to observe using traditional paper-based or CATI-bases travel diary surveys. For example, one can expect that self-assessments of how individuals travel across transit district zones and district borders can only be answered reliably by individuals with some knowledge of the fare system, not everyone. Here, using GPS tracking can be considered an appropriate supplement or substitute to questionnaires to measure travel behavior and its changes over a long time period. Such tracking-based survey approaches generally work in creating travel diaries ( 15 ), and it is beneficial in correcting underor false reporting in traditional approaches ( 16 \u2013 18 ).

( 1996 ) who define the IRFs as state-and-history-dependent random variables. The simulated IRFs show that prices immediately decline after a positive interest rate shock and converge slowly to their long-run value. Moreover, an interest rate increase depresses storage and increases price volatility. Inventories decrease immediately with the shock but reach their lowest value after a long time, and convergence to the long-run average is even slower compared with price. Price volatility mostly follows stock dynamics: a larger response in inventory causes an oppositely larger response in price volatility. Finally, the magnitude and overall pattern of the IRFs depend substantially on the market supply and interest rate regimes. 8\n\nFootnote 8: These results suggest that postulating an invariant effect of monetary shocks under different market supply and interest rate regimes may cause biases in empirical analysis.\n\nOur work joins a large literature on the relationship between interest rates and commodity prices. Jeffrey Frankel made numerous empirical and theoretical contributions on the topic, with an emphasis on how commodity prices overshoot their long-run target following a shock because of their inherent price flexibility ( Frankel and Hardouvelis , 1985 ; Frankel , 1986 , 2008 , 2014 ). This literature has tended to find a negative effect of inter- est rate hikes on commodity prices in the short ( Rosa , 2014 ; Basistha and Kurov , 2015 ; Scrimgeour , 2015 ) and medium run ( Akram , 2009 ; Anzuini et al. , 2013 ; Harvey et al. , 2017 ), with the exception of Kilian and Zhou ( 2022 ) who find no effect of real interest rate movements on oil prices. The negative relationship of interest rates and commodity prices has also been detected by Christiano et al. ( 1999 ) and Bernanke et al. ( 2005 ) in other contexts. In addition, interest rates not only affect commodity price levels, but also their cross-correlation and their volatility as shown by Gruber and Vigfusson ( 2018 ). Compared with these studies, the method developed here allows for a systematic analysis of the transmission mechanisms. In particular, our quantitative analysis clarifies the role of the speculative channel in the observed negative relationship. Our work contributes also to the studies of the theoretical and empirical properties of the competitive storage model. Theoretically, we derive new results on the existence and uniqueness of a rational expectations equilibrium in a general competitive storage model with state-dependent and time-varying discount factors, which extend the results of Scheinkman and Schechtman ( 1983 ), Deaton and Laroque ( 1992 ), Cafiero et al. ( 2015 ) and is crucial for studying the dynamic causal effect of these factors on commodity price fluctuations. 9 9 See also Basak and Pavlova ( 2016 ) for another storage model with stochastic discount factor but which abstracts from the non-negative constraint on storage.\n\n "

Finally, the magnitude and overall pattern of the IRFs depend substantially on the market supply and interest rate regimes.8\n\nFootnote 8: These results suggest that postulating an invariant effect of monetary shocks under different market supply and interest rate regimes may cause biases in empirical analysis.\n\nOur work joins a large literature on the relationship between interest rates and commodity prices. Jeffrey Frankel made numerous empirical and theoretical contributions on the topic, with an emphasis on how commodity prices overshoot their long-run target following a shock because of their inherent price flexibility (Frankel and Hardouvelis, 1985; Frankel, 1986, 2008, 2014). This literature has tended to find a negative effect of interest rate hikes on commodity prices in the short (Rosa, 2014; Basistha and Kurov, 2015; Scrimgeour, 2015) and medium run (Akram, 2009; Anzuini et al., 2013; Harvey et al., 2017), with the exception of Kilian and Zhou (2022) who find no effect of real interest rate movements on oil prices. The negative relationship of interest rates and commodity prices has also been detected by Christiano et al. (1999) and Bernanke et al. (2005) in other contexts. In addition, interest rates not only affect commodity price levels, but also their cross-correlation and their volatility as shown by Gruber and Vigfusson (2018). Compared with these studies, the method developed here allows for a systematic analysis of the transmission mechanisms. In particular, our quantitative analysis clarifies the role of the speculative channel in the observed negative relationship.\n\nOur work contributes also to the studies of the theoretical and empirical properties of the competitive storage model. Theoretically, we derive new results on the existence and uniqueness of a rational expectations equilibrium in a general competitive storage model with state-dependent and time-varying discount factors, which extend the results of Scheinkman and Schechtman (1983), Deaton and Laroque (1992), Cafiero et al. (2015) and is crucial for studying the dynamic causal effect of these factors on commodity price fluctuations.9 In addition, we provide a sharp characterization of the analytical properties of the equilibrium solution, based on which we develop a suitable endogenous grid "

      "equilibrium is unique by Proposition 3 , under the conditions in Theorem 1 , there are no equilibria in which the land price equals its fundamental value. Theorem 1 has three important implications. First, it clarifies the role of unbalanced growth and elasticity of substitution for generating land overvaluation, which was previously overlooked. Regarding the assumption of elasticity of substitution between land and non-land exceeding 1, we justify it on empirical and theoretical grounds as discussed in Section 3.2 . Second, we can derive a new insight on the long-run behavior of land prices in a modern economy. The conventional view is that on the long-run trend, the land price should reflect its fundamental value, even if it may deviate from the fundamental value temporarily. In sharp contrast with this widely-held view, Theorem 1 implies that during the process of economic development characterized by unbalanced productivity growth, land overvaluation will naturally and necessarily arise. 6 Before discussing the third implication in Section 3.4 , we show that all examples in Section 2 are special cases of Theorem 1.\n\nFootnote 6: Of course, if \\(G_{H}=G_{X}\\) holds in the long run, which is often assumed to ensure a balanced growth path in the growth literature, there will be no overvaluation in land prices but this is 3.4 , we show that all examples in Section obviously a knife-edge case. 2 are special cases of Theorem 1 . 2 is true.\n\n**Corollary 2.** Proposition 2 is true.\n\nProof.: Define the aggregate production function by\n\n\\[F_{t}(H,X)=A_{1 t}H_{1}H+A_{2 t}(H_{2}H)^{\\alpha}X^{1- \\alpha},\\]\n\nwhere \\(H_{1},H_{2}&gt;0\\) are constants.

First, it clarifies the role of unbalanced growth and elasticity of substitution for generating land overvaluation, which was previously overlooked. Regarding the assumption of elasticity of substitution between land and non-land exceeding 1, we justify it on empirical and theoretical grounds as discussed in Section 3.2.\n\nSecond, we can derive a new insight on the long-run behavior of land prices in a modern economy. The conventional view is that on the long-run trend, the land price should reflect its fundamental value, even if it may deviate from the fundamental value temporarily. In sharp contrast with this widely-held view, Theorem 1 implies that during the process of economic development characterized by unbalanced productivity growth, land overvaluation will naturally and necessarily arise. 6\n\nFootnote 6: Of course, if \\(G_{H}=G_{X}\\) holds in the long run, which is often assumed to ensure a balanced growth path in the growth literature, there will be no overvaluation in land prices but this is obviously a knife-edge case.\n\nBefore discussing the third implication in Section 3.4, we show that all examples in Section 2 are special cases of Theorem 1.\n\n**Corollary 2**.: _Proposition 2 is true._\n\nProof.: Define the aggregate production function by\n\n\\[F_{t}(H,X)=A_{1 t}H_{1}H+A_{2 t}(H_{2}H)^{\\alpha}X^{1- \\alpha},\\]\n\nwhere \\(H_{1},H_{2}&gt;0\\) are constants. Define\n\n\\[F(H,X) =H_{2}H+H_{2}^{\\alpha}H^{\\alpha}X^{1-\\alpha},\\] \\[(A_{Ht},A_{Xt}) =(A_{1 t},(A_{2 t}/A_{1 t}^{\\alpha})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}).\\]\n\nThen clearly \\(F_{t}(H,X)=F(A_{Ht}H,A_{Xt}X)\\) and Assumption 1 holds. Assumption 2 holds by Example 3. If \\(A_{j t}=G_{j}^{t}\\) with \\(G_{1}&gt;G_{2}\\), then\n\n\\[A_{Ht}/A_{Xt}=(A_{1 t}/A_{2 t})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}=(G_{1}/G_{2})^{\\frac{t}{1- \\alpha}},\\]\n\nso ( 3.7 ) holds.\n\n**Corollary 3**.: _Land is overvalued in Example 1 if \\(G_{1}&gt;G_{2}\\)._ "
